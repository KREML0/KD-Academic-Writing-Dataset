1	14834	6	3	There were many obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to have dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building. Safety was a major issue with the dirigibles because of the highly flammable gas hydrogen that they used. So, if the dirigibles exploded over New York many people could be killed in the very populated city. Another problem was keeping the dirigible stable so people could safely disembark while the wind moved the back end. The only proposed way to counteract this was to tie lead weights down in the back of the dirigible, but dropping those weights would be dangerous over the crowds down below. So, these significant obstacles proved insurmountable for the workers, and they never solved the docking issues; thus, they instead made the world's highest soda fountain and tea garden for tourists in the observation area.
2	14835	6	3	Him from the start, there would have been many problems with allowing dirigibles to dock some 1,250 feet in the air. The major problem here would be that the Empire State building was being constructed in New York City, a highly populated area. Below the mooring mast would be several other buildings where other people worked and lived. If something happened while the dirigible was attempting to dock, it could take out the building and the lives of the people in it. Not only that, but below were the city streets, where pedestrians walked. In paragraphs two, the passage also talks about the stress of a heavy, steel framed airship mooring at the top of the building. The frame would need to be very dense and, as the architects of the project discovered, expensive. Other safety issues include the high winds that would drift the dirigibles off course, and the safety of dirigibles themselves. The passage mentions the Hindenburg incident, as well as the worry the owners of the building had about that happening over such a densely populated area, making the docking idea ultimately too risky to seriously pursue.
3	14836	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that the dirigible would have to be held by a single cable tether, putting significant strain on the building. This would add stress to the building's frame, and in order to make the frame sturdy enough to withstand these forces, modifications to the building's framework were required, costing over sixty thousand dollars. Another obstacle the builders faced was the dirigible's use of hydrogen, which is highly flammable. Since New York was a densely populated area, the potential for disaster was considerable, making this an unacceptable risk. The dirigibles would also have to be weighted down in the back with lead weights to maintain stability during docking. In order to do so, the lead weights would end up dangling high above pedestrians on the street, posing a significant safety issue. One last obstacle the builders faced was the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law essentially made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even safely approach the area. Ultimately, these significant hurdles proved insurmountable, and the dirigible docking plan was abandoned, highlighting the impracticality of the initial concept.
4	14837	6	3	"In the passage The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. One reason is that Al Smith (four-term governor of New York who headed efforts to construct the Empire State Building after his years in office) had made the tower tall. The height of the building was 1,250 ft. But after almost losing the title of world's tallest tower, he announced that there would be a top or hat put on the tower, adding to its height and solidifying its claim. Another reason is the tower was made for Dirigibles (blimps) that could @CAPS2 transport people from New York to New Jersey. Smith wanted a place where dirigibles could dock. But it never happened because the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, and on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it was over New York, given the building's height and the city's density. In the 1930s the idea was dropped after another dirigible was trying to perform a stunt, further demonstrating the dangers of docking these airships. The Empire State Building never got to fulfill what it was initially designed for, and the mooring mast became more of a symbolic feature than a functional one."
5	14838	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle they faced was the existing law against airships flying too low in urban areas. This made it illegal for the dirigible to tie up on the building. Another obstacle faced in allowing dirigibles to dock was safety, specifically the risk of fire. Most dirigibles used hydrogen which was highly flammable. If a dirigible caught fire over the densely populated area of New York, there would be a good chance that many people would be hurt, creating a devastating scenario. A final obstacle faced was ""nature itself."" The winds on the top of the Empire State building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even though a dirigible would be attached to the mooring mast, the back of it would move around the mooring mast in a dangerous way, making docking a difficult and precarious process. Many obstacles were faced by the workers of the Empire State Building in order to allow a dirigible to dock there, ultimately making the endeavor impractical."
6	14839	6	3	Soon after its conception, The Empire State Building mooring mast was doomed to fail. Early obstacles were easily surmounted; for example, the problem of added stress on the building's frame caused by the added weight of the moored airship. This was fixed by structural modifications to the building's frame, an expensive but fairly simple procedure. One of the biggest blows to the project was the advent of the Hindenburg disaster, which accelerated the decline in airships. Airplanes became a safer, faster, more desirable form of transportation. In addition to the Hindenburg disaster, it soon became clear that mooring an airship at 1000' or higher was not feasible. Surging winds would not allow the airship to maintain its course, and the ship would be blown erratically around the mast. The final nail in the coffin for the mooring mast was a law prohibiting airship travel over urban areas. These multiple factors easily disallowed any possibility of successful airship travel in the future.
7	14840	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building were faced with obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The architects realized they could not put the mooring mast on top of the building without modifying and strengthening the steel frame of the building. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would add too much weight to the framework which could cause it to collapse. They strengthened the framework from the bottom of the building to the top before putting the shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower on the top of the building. Although the builders were faced with these obstacles, they were successful in completing their goal of erecting the tower. The mooring mast is not used as a docking station, as initially planned, but it is still looked at as the final piece that makes the Empire State Building stand out above all buildings in downtown New York City.
8	14841	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, many complications occurred during the plans and construction of the attempted docking mast. One obstacle was that dirigibles were just too heavy and the metal frame of the building would have to be modified. After repairing the framework of the Empire State Building, two trial runs were displayed by the U.S. Navy dirigible ""Los Angeles"" and the Goodyear blimp ""Columbia"". The result of the experiment was that the wind current, physically, didn't allow the blimp to come close enough to the building to dock. Also, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban cities"" was an obstacle they could not surpass. Within years of postponing their efforts, airplanes made way and dirigibles, as transportation, were long forgotten, rendering the mooring mast project obsolete."
9	14842	6	3	The obstacles the builders face were great. They explained how most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION1, which was identified as New York City, use a different gas called hydrogen which is highly flammable. Following that they told @LOCATION1 how the Hindenburg disaster occurred by fire in 1937 which used hydrogen. They realized if this had happen in a urban area it could have been worse. Another obstacle they faced was the wind. If the dirigible was parked at mooring mast the violent wind speeds would make the Blimp shift and cause stress on the building steel frame. The greatest obstacle was the law passed. The law stated that no airships could fly to low in urban areas. This would keep blimps from landing there, ultimately hindering the project's goal of convenient urban air travel.
10	14843	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building a great idea. They wanted to be able to tethered dirigibles, or blimps, to the top of the building. However, there were many problems with this idea. First of all, blimps themselves were not very sturdy, making docking difficult. Strong winds could easily blow dirigibles trying to dock into the spires of other buildings. Dirigibles also started to use hydrogen gas rather than Helium for lift. Hydrogen gas is extremely flammable, posing a significant risk. The smallest sparking could set the whole blimp ablaze. The docking system its self was also a problem due to the blimps' instability. The only way to keep a dirigible level was to hang lead weights off the side of the airship. One concern was that a weight could fall off and fall into the densely populated city below. This could've proved very disastrous, making the entire concept far too dangerous to implement.
11	14844	6	3	The Empire State Building's docking zone was a magnificent and novel idea when it was first conceived, but it was too difficult to implement. Al Smith, who spearheaded the operation, was too overanxious to complete it. Since not enough time was devoted to researching the risks and structure of the dock, the plan to mount it on top of the Empire State Building was already a failure. Before the construction even began, trouble started to brew. The building couldn't withstand the stress of the 200-foot long dirigible. The shock to the building would have transmitted tremendous pressure to the foundation, so the roof would have to be redone in order for it to be structurally sound. After many months and millions of dollars, the creation of the landing dock could begin. Life is precious, and the landing dock was too volatile and dangerous to be used. The architects overlooked the fact that most foreign ones were made of hydrogen, not helium. Hydrogen is extremely flammable. In Lakehurst, New Jersey, the Hindenburg, which was constructed using hydrogen, caught aflame and killed hundreds. There was even a law stating that aircraft could not be suspended so close to an urban area. The idea was ostentatious and showy, but because it was rushed, precautions were not taken into account. The obstacles that faced the docking station were too much, so finally, the plan to erect it was abandoned, proving that sometimes even the most ambitious dreams must yield to practicality and safety concerns.
12	14845	6	3	"During the construction of the Empire State Building to allow dirigibles to dock, there were constant obstacles faced by the builders. Architects could not place a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building. 800 ft dirigibles would add stress the buildings framework, therefore causing the architects to modify the framework. This would cost them an extra $2 million for the modifications. The Architects don't know if these modifications will help. Safety is another concern. Foreign dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, which is highly flammable. For example ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place over a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" The Architects also had to worry about atmospheric static and the constant shifting of the winds due to violent air currents. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship which swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Usually dirigibles land in open fields where they are weighed down so they won't drift away, except it is impossible to weigh down the dirigible in the air. They dangle high above pedestrians walking around on the streets, therefore making it not safe. There is also the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to a building or even approach the area."" There were two attempts to dock on the building. One was in December 1930, the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles Attempted to dock except it couldn't get close enough to to high velocity winds. ""By the late 1930s, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers had quietly disappeared."" Ultimately, the impracticality and dangers associated with docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building led to the abandonment of the project, as airplanes became the future."
13	14846	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles trying to construct this marvelous building. One obstacle was making sure the stress of the building from the dirigible would go to the foundation of the building and not the top or middle where it could cause it to collapse. As said in the text ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over @MONEY1 worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" @CAPS1 the building had to be changed in many ways to make it stable enough for dirigible to dock. Another obstacle was the weather above the building, which consisted of very strong winds and unpredictable air currents. This would mean that the dirigible would just be ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street,"" and that's not a safe thing to have highly flammable hydrogen floating around above millions. An obstacle as well that came with these dirigibles was all the time and effort they had to put in to learn how to safely install a mooring mast, including safety protocols. This took people going to professionals like the Navy and finding out the proper way to secure such a large airship. The mooring mast on the Empire State Building caused many obstacles to get in the way, and ultimately, these various challenges proved too great to overcome."
14	14847	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast. Al Smith was the driving force, and man behind the idea of the Empire State building. He and the maker of the Chrysler building were competing against each other to construct the world's tallest building. To make the Empire State building bigger than the Chrysler building, Smith was going to construct something that John Tauranac stated, ""Would be equipped for an age of transportation that was only the dream of aviation pioneers"". That dream was to travel by blimp. The Empire State Building was going to have a mooring mast at its top for the dock of air ships. It was not going to be as easy as the concept. The architects couldn't simply drop a mooring mast on the roof because it would stress the building's frame. The greatest reason the mast would never fulfill its destiny was for safety; the airships would have to winch up passengers and cargo. The excerpt states, ""Most dirigibles used hydrogen"". Hydrogen is flammable. There was also a law that was, ""against air ships flying too low over urban areas"". After numerous attempts and modifications, the idea was shelved, and the grand vision of blimp travel to the Empire State Building ultimately remained a dream unfulfilled."
15	14848	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the lack of a suitable landing area. A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on, using an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mast. The body of the dirigible could swing in the breeze, and passengers could safely get on and off the dirigible by walking down a gangplank to an open observation platform. They of the Empire State Building consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations of the U.S. Naval Air station in Lakehurst, New Jersey, to better understand the practical challenges involved in safely mooring and servicing these giant airships. Ultimately, this research helped inform their ambitious, albeit ultimately unsuccessful, plan.
16	14849	6	3	"@CAPS1 The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, shows the thoughtful, intelligent, yet obstacled ideas of attaching a landing dock to the Empire State building. The obstacles that builders of the Empire State building had to overcome were that wind speeds where the dirigibles would land were too strong and would whip the balloon around like a rag doll. They would ""have to use lead weights"" which would pose another problem, questioning the foundation of the building. The weight of the building also the weight of the lead weights might collapse the structure. Further complicating matters, the gases they use ""hydrogen and hellium"" make the balloon fly, but hydrogen ""is highly flamable and can't be used in populated areas."" There was also ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" @CAPS2 These considerable problems, from structural concerns to safety regulations, are the obstacles and the reason ""the mooring mast of The Empire State building was destined never to fullfill its purpose""."
17	14850	6	3	In Marcia Amidon L¸sted's excerpt, The Mooring Mast, many obstacles had the engineers of the Empire State Building looking for a new way to dock dirigibles. One obstacle they had to face was the steel work of the building; the immense pressure of the wind and the dirigible's load against the structure had cost the company around $MONEY1. Secondly, they had to design a few special floors specifically for the passengers of the dirigibles. One floor would be designated for baggage and suitcases, while a special observation deck was set up to allow passengers to safely exit or enter the ship. Lastly, the building would now be 102 floors and would need to be exceptionally durable, so special, high-strength materials were required to be brought in and utilized to create the building's framework. All in all, the Empire State Building engineers had to overcome many significant obstacles when constructing the ambitious 1,250 ft. building.
18	14851	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges in their ambitious plan to accommodate dirigibles. Allowing dirigibles to dock there presented problems with the wind, the actual docking procedure, and ensuring the safe disembarkation of passengers. The actual docking was impractical because connecting the winch system would have been nearly impossible. The wind proved to be the most significant obstacle. The wind current's strength posed a major hurdle, making it exceedingly difficult for pilots to maneuver close enough to the mast. The captain of the Navy dirigible Los Angeles, for instance, approached the mooring mast but could not establish a connection due to the forceful winds. Moreover, even if a connection were made, the dirigible's tail section would swing around violently. Ultimately, the builders were faced with overcoming a highly impractical task, largely due to uncontrollable weather elements, which led to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan.
19	14852	6	3	The first obstacle that it faced was having to reconstruct the body frame so that it could adequately support the mooring mast. The second is that dirigibles from other countries used hydrogen, which is highly flammable, instead of the much safer helium. The third reason, which should have been apparent from the start, was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The last reason is that the wind conditions at that height made it practically impossible for the dirigibles to land there without the tail swaying violently in the wind. These challenges ultimately proved insurmountable, hindering the successful implementation of the airship program.
20	14853	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there included stress to the building's frame. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework to prepare for the immense forces involved. Ultimately, this significant structural challenge contributed to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan.
21	14854	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in an attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major obstacle was constructing a mooring mast that would not threaten the building's structure. The builders had to modify and strengthen the frame of the Empire State Building. According to the excerpt ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the framework."" Another big obstacle was safety. At the Empire State Building's height, it would have been illegal to land a dirigible. The dirigibles, at that time, were filled with hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. If the dirigible ever exploded, it would threaten the hundreds of pedestrians on the streets of New York City, making the prospect of safely docking airships incredibly risky. These challenges ultimately proved insurmountable, leading to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan."
22	14855	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's Foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred Feet below."" The wind current would cause the dirigible to drag the building with it because the wind current is very strong. The weight of the dirigible and the pressure of the wind may cause the building to collapse. Al Smith realized that he was close to losing the title of the world's tallest building, and on December 11, 1929, he announced that the Empire State Building would now reach the height of 1,250 Feet. Al Smith didn't want to lose his title so he decides to to make the building taller. The taller the building gets the stronger the wind current will be the more it adds on the building. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe. Dirigibles should land in wide open areas where there isn't anything to harm the blimp, citizens, and passengers. The gases that are used to inflate the dirigible to make it lighter than air are highly Flammable. Ultimately, the challenges of wind, weight, and safety concerns regarding flammable gases proved too significant to overcome, leading to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan. These are some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State building had to consider."
23	14856	6	3	"In the reading The Mooring Mast written by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced an obstacle: attempting to allow Dirigibles to dock there, as Dirigibles were thought of being the transportation of the future. First, ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area"" (@NUM1). This quote shows that for one this Dirigible would need to find a proper landing area, and might not be able to fit, suggesting a need for more area space. Also, ""some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City"" (@NUM2). It seems as though there was not enough space due to the Dirigible's great length. This raises the question of how the architects would devise a plan to make this work, ensuring a proper fit. Therefore, the builders of the Empire State Building faced the obstacle of a lack of a suitable area."
24	14857	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced difficult circumstances and many obstacles during the task of designing a brand new Empire State Building to accompany this new means of travel. The builder's mission was to design the top of the Empire State Building to accommodate the mooring of blimps over one thousand feet in the air. The first obstacle was designing a landing area. This was difficult because the architecture needed had never before been created or even attempted in the past, requiring innovative solutions. A second obstacle was having to make sure the Empire State Building could withstand the stress created by the blimp. Paragraph @NUM1 says ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" The difficulty with this obstacle was having to refurbish the steel frame at the Empire State Building which took lots of time, work, and over sixty thousand dollars to reinforce. ""The greatest obstacles to successful mooring was nature itself."" There were violent wind currents at the top of the building, making the blimps never very stable. There were many pedestrians under a moored dirigible, so this was a very dangerous obstacle that could have resulted in tragedy. Lastly, the pre existing laws of airships flying the low over urban areas posed a new problem. Even with successful architecture, laws disallowed the blimps in the first place! Planes were also becoming more popular, further diminishing the necessity for such a mooring system. In conclusion, despite the initial ambition, a combination of structural, environmental, legal, and technological factors ultimately made the blimp mooring idea impractical."
25	14858	6	3	"In building the Empire State Building, the builders faced some problems in allowing dirigibles to dock there. Some of the obstacles that the builder faced were actually having a way for dirigibles to dock at about 1,250 feet above the ground. The strong air currents and changing in the wind direction also made it difficult for the piolots to steer the dirigibles close enough to the mast for docking. A final problem that the builders faced was a law that ""airships flying too low over urban areas"". (@NUM1). Which basically means that if it was docked at the Empire State building, then it would be too low to an urban aera and that's against the law, ultimately rendering the dirigible docking plan impractical."
26	14859	6	3	"The idea of mooring dirigibles to the top of the building that stood 1,250 feet above the streets of downtown New York was a fascinating and amazing idea. An idea that would bring New York into a whole ""age of transportation"" (@NUM1). Unfortunately this wonderful idea had a few holes in the plans. Later the architects that were building the mooring mast had discovered that their idea was not going to be fulfilled. The idea had too many obstacles to overcome. The fact that ""most dirigibles outside the U. S used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@NUM2) posed a significant safety risk. If anything was to go wrong, it would be catastrophic seeing as how below them were highly populated streets. Also, ""the greatest obstacle was nature itself"" (@NUM3), specifically the unpredictable and often intense winds at that altitude. There was just too much wind to keep the aircraft steady and under control, making docking a dangerous maneuver. The reality of the fact was that the idea to moor dirigibles sounded great but there are far too many risks to carry out the plan, ultimately rendering the ambitious mooring mast impractical."
27	14860	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring @CAPS1"", by: Marcia Amidon @CAPS2 the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose due to many reasons and many obstacles. One of those many reason was that most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Furthermore the biggest obstacle to the sucessful use of morning mast was nature itself. Due to the reason that the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. Using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the Street, was neither practical nor safe. The other obstacles was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area, although two dirigibles did attempt to reach the building for the entire idea was dropped. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many hard obstacles. Thus, with safety concerns related to both the flammable nature of hydrogen and the unpredictable winds, along with legal restrictions, the impracticality of the mooring mast became clear."
28	14861	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building face many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle they faced was the safety issue. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, most foreign dirigibles used the flammable element hydrogen rather than helium. A fire would be very deadly in a highly populated area like downtown New York. Another obstacle the builders were faced with was the wind. In paragraph @NUM2 it says, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would cause the un-tied back of the dirigible to thrash around and even ""swivel around the mooring mast."" When a dirigible is moored in open fields, they can be weighted down with lead weights. Doing this in open air above the Empire State building would be unsafe due to pedestrians below, posing a significant risk of falling debris. The final obstacle builders faced was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. In paragraph @NUM3, it says, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."" Ultimately, these combined safety, logistical, and legal concerns ensured that the mooring mast for dirigibles of the Empire State building never served its intended purpose."
29	14862	6	3	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, there were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced with allowing dirigibles to land there. One of the obstacles were the safety problems. The dirigibles had to come close enough to the Empire State Building so they could be able to tie the dirigible down. This put the dirigibles too close to the people on the open-air observation deck. There was a law that stated that airships can't fly too low to urban areas. The builders were concerned about a disaster that happened in Lakehurst, New Jersey, and they were trying to prevent a similar tragedy from happening in New York (paragraph @NUM1). Another problem the builders faced was that the strong winds of nature did not allow dirigibles to get close enough to tie down to the mast; even experienced pilots struggled with the unpredictable gusts at that height. There were many obstacles builders had to face that, in the end, it was not worth making the Empire State Building a dirigible dock, leading them to abandon the ambitious plan."
30	14863	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. The steel frame of the Building needed to be modified and strengthened to make a place for dirigibles to dock, which added to the complexity of the construction. Also, over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to accommodate the mooring system. The last obstacle builders had was that a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building would add stress to the building's frame, raising concerns about structural integrity. It was not easy for builders to build a mooring mast on top of the highest building that was one thousand two hundred fifty feet, presenting significant engineering challenges, but the architects reached their point by designing the mooring mast, ultimately overcoming these difficulties to complete the ambitious project.
31	14864	6	3	While building the Empire State Building, workers faced many obstacles while attempting for dirigibles to dock there. A dirigible attached to the mast and building would add extra stress, so builders instead had to spend over sixty thousand dollars worth of reconstructions to fix the building's framework to handle the load. Dirigibles also dock with a line running from the front of the ship to the mast, and while they planned for the blimp to be able to sway in the wind, it was unrealistic that any ship could attach to the building in the face of such high winds at that altitude. Other obstacles they faced in letting dirigibles dock at the building were the potential safety hazards, as the hydrogen used in most dirigibles from outside of the U.S. was highly flammable and posed a risk. Builders also did not take into consideration the pre-existing law against airships flying too low over urbanized areas, so it was illegal for a dirigible to tie to the building in the first place. The task of having dirigibles attach to the Empire State building was therefore an impossible task to begin with.
32	14865	6	3	There were many reasons why architects had problems allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One of the problems was that most dirigibles were @NUM1 ft long and it would be too much. There would only be a single cable tether and it would add stress to the building's frame. The entire steel frame would have to be modified and strengthened, which would cost over sixty thousand dollars. The greatest reason why the mooring mast would never fulfill its purpose is safety. Most dirigibles from the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, posing a significant risk. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring was nature itself. The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around. They are meant to land on open playing fields, but using these at the Empire State Building where they would be dangling high above pedestrians was not safe, thus making the idea impractical and ultimately unfeasible.
33	14866	6	3	The builders faced several obstacles. One challenge was using hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. Another significant issue was the wind on the top of the building, where constantly shifting and violent air currents created difficulties. Furthermore, the back of the ship would sometimes swivel uncontrollably around the mooring mast, posing a risk during docking. Finally, existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, limiting approach options. Overcoming these hurdles was essential for the project's success, highlighting the complex and multifaceted nature of the undertaking.
34	14867	6	3	There were many obstacles that builders had to face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the wind. At higher elevation the wind is much more powerful, particularly at the top of the Empire State Building. This would make it very difficult to actually get the dirigible close to the mast, requiring immense skill from the airship pilots. Also, there was the structure of the Empire State Building itself. The framework was not originally built for the amount of weight that a docking dirigible and its passengers would place on top of the building. Builders made over @MONEY1 worth of fortifying the framework to withstand the added stress. Those are some obstacles that builders had to face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, highlighting the ambitious and ultimately impractical nature of the plan.
35	14868	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Although the builders thought it to be a brilliant idea, they did not carefully consider the safety hazards they may have encountered, and how unrealistic the idea truly was. One of the greatest reasons the mooring mast was destined to be unable to fulfill its purpose was because of safety concerns. In paragraph @NUM1 it states ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen... and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The potential for disaster was immense. When a dirigible was destroyed by fire in New Jersey, the owners of the Empire State building realized how much worse an accident like that would be if it occurred over a place as densely populated as downtown New York. Another very practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the top of the building was, as stated in paragraph @NUM2, ""there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This also made maneuvering such a large craft next to the building extremely difficult, even if it was otherwise safe. That would make it impossible for a dirigible to even approach the area, let alone be able to tie up to the building. It is very apparent that the builders of the Empire State Building faced many issues in the attempt. Ultimately, these safety concerns and existing regulations made the dirigible docking plan entirely impractical."
36	14869	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building seem blind of all the dangers that would be a result of the mooring mast. One huge factor in danger was the violent winds at that elevation. The blimp would be swung around on the tether going to the building, which could either damage the building itself, or damage the blimp. Also, if the blimp was moving, how would passengers get on and off? They could fall off the loading dock whether they were going on or off the blimp, due to the height and potential for missteps. Passengers could even get blown off the open floor of the Empire State building while waiting. Another factor was the high population of New York City; if something like debris had fallen down to the streets from the blimp or the building, it could probably kill a few walking pedestrians. It seems clear that the plan presented many potential hazards that could have resulted in injury or death. I would think that the architects would have considered all these factors before trying to begin the project, but apparently, the allure of innovation overshadowed these significant safety concerns.
37	14870	6	3	In the excerpt, the Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the construction of the Empire State Building faced many problems. One of these problems is that the governor of New York, Al Smith, wanted the building to be the tallest in the world. In order to do this, you would need a mast to break the record. The mast made to made nature a danger to the whole building because of violent air currents. Another reason how the Empire State Building failed is because there was a law banning airships flying too low over urban areas. This law went in effect because of a German dirigible caught on fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, adding to the danger. These difficulties, along with the challenging economics of airship travel, contributed to the ultimate failure of the mooring mast concept.
38	14871	6	3	Builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A one thousand-foot dirigible, attached to a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame if the dirigible was placed at the top of the building. The building's frame would have to be strengthened and modified to accommodate the situation. Over @MONEY1 worth of modifications would have to be installed into the framework. Some other obstacles builders faced were related to safety concerns. The dirigibles ran on hydrogen which is flammable. Another obstacle was the weather; the winds shifted at the top of the Empire State Building due to violent air currents. One last obstacle was an existing law that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. Ultimately, due to these significant challenges, the idea of a dirigible quietly disappeared.
39	14872	6	3	Although Al Smith had expected the mooring mast of the Empire State Building to be unique and practical, builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, in order for the building to accommodate the stress that the dirigibles would add to the building's frame, the framework of the building had to be modified with extra steel. This cost over sixty thousand dollars. In addition, dirigibles used hydrogen-a highly flammable gas-for lift. An accident involving the hydrogen could be fatal in a densely-populated area like New York City. Also, there were violent winds at the top of the building that would making docking difficult and could possibly blow a dirigible into the side of the building, causing it to be punctured and leak gas. Finally, an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas; it would be illegal for a ship even to approach the building's area, further complicating the docking concept. These issues ultimately rendered the plan impractical.
40	14873	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many difficult obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. The greatest obstacle of the use of a mooring mast was the wind, which proved to be a formidable challenge. At the top of the Empire State Building, the winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The winds would cause the back of the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast, making docking a dangerous and unpredictable endeavor. Another reason the dirigibles would not be able to moor at the Empire State Building is because there is a law that says airships cannot fly low in urban areas. This would make it illegal for the dirigible to approach or dock at the Empire State Building, effectively ending the possibility of using the mooring mast. Therefore, the combination of dangerous winds and legal restrictions made the dirigible docking plan impractical.
41	14874	6	3	Based on the story it all started when they had built the Empire State Building, and the workers should have known that the building was too big for the wind climate up in the sky; plus, when you make a building like that, you have to make sure it's strong enough to keep balance. They faced problems, like when the U.S. tried to make a deal with them if they would let them use the top of the building for a dock to let civilians on the deck, and after they made a law that no more blimps can land on the dock, a blimp attempted to land on the dock.
42	14875	6	3	Obstacles the builders faced was if they put a Mooring **Mast** at the top of the building it will add stress to the building and they would have to modify the building to support the mooring **mast**. Another **challenge** they **encountered** is safety. Most **airships** are filled with hydrogen which are highly flammable. If there was a fire it could **endanger** **the lives** of people due to the fact it's a densely populated area. Nature itself also seems to **pose** a **challenge**, the winds above the building were very violent. Then there's the law where airships can **not fly** low above urban areas. Therefore, several significant engineering and regulatory issues needed careful consideration.
43	14876	6	3	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are described. One obstacle was that most dirigibles were highly flammable. In paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Therefore, the risk of fire was a major concern. If a dirigible caught on fire near the Empire State Building, the accident would affect many people since its a densely populated area. Another obstacle the builders faced was the winds of nature itself. Even if a dirigible was docked, it would still swivel around too much. In paragraph @NUM2 it says, ""... they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" This made passenger transfer extremely dangerous. One more obstacle they faced was an existing law. In paragraph @NUM3 it says, ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" Therefore, legal restrictions further complicated the matter. The architects faced many obstacles while trying to bring their idea to reality. It's better to plan ahead and think of every obstacle before bringing ideas to life."
44	14877	6	3	The builders had a very hard time because of where it was located, and how the dirigible was to dock. Their first problem was the fact that it was so tall, making it hard to work on the upper reaches of the mooring mast itself. Another problem was the fact that the blimp would be pulling in on the building, requiring significant structural reinforcement to withstand the immense forces. The final problems that made them most an unreliable choice were the high wind conditions at that altitude and the fact that the tail end of the blimp could swing freely, creating unpredictable stresses. These all contributed to make the mast on the Empire State Building a bad idea, ultimately proving impractical and unsafe for regular airship docking.
45	14878	6	3	"From the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, the architects building the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. An obstacle they faced in attempting to let the dirigibles dock there were the winds. As it says in the excerpt, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around..."" The dirigible would not be stable in those conditions. Another obstacle they faced was how to weigh it down; they'd have to use lead weight, but it wouldn't be ""practical nor safe"" dangling high above people in New York City on the Street. Overall, the architects faced a lot of obstacles for docking the dirigibles, most being either impractical or unsafe, ultimately making the ambitious plan unfeasible."
46	14879	6	3	When designing the mast, the builders realized that the building's frame would experience considerable stress under the weight of a docked dirigible, potentially compromising its structural integrity. (paragraph @NUM1) Furthermore, they noticed that dirigibles from other countries frequently used hydrogen, not helium, for lift, which presented a significant fire hazard due to hydrogen's highly flammable nature. (paragraph @NUM2) Nature presented another uncontrollable factor, as the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting and unpredictable, making docking maneuvers perilous. (paragraph @NUM3) Legal restrictions also posed a problem, as existing laws prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, thus creating a regulatory hurdle. (paragraph @NUM4) The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles with these factors of weight, gas, nature, and law, ultimately rendering the dirigible docking plan impractical.
47	14880	6	3	"In the excerpt from, ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, tells about the original purpose to the mast on top of the Empire State Building was to serve as a landing spot for dirigibles (blimps). Some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced was the tremendous stress that the mast would put on the Empire State Building. In order to get around this, they put frame work around the entire building's frame, essentially creating a building within a building. Another obstacle that was faced was safety. First of all, the wind at the top of the Empire State Building was too great for any blimp to stay aloft in mid-air without being tossed around. Finally, the possibility of the blimp either popping on the spikes, or blowing up because of the hydrogen, over New York City, presented an unacceptable level of risk. In conclusion, the mast on the Empire State Building, looked good on paper, but once you add in natural elements, the mast had too many flaws to it."
48	14881	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was modifying and strengthening the frame of the building, as over @NUM1 thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework in order to accommodate dirigibles. However, after the modifications were made, the builders had to face another set of obstacles, more serious than before. The first one was safety: the destruction of the Hindenburg in @LOCATION3 raised fear for a densely populated area such as New York. Another obstacle was nature; the strong winds and violent air currents on the top of the Empire State Building made dirigibles neither practical nor safe. The third obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. The Los Angeles and Columbia dirigibles attempted a few things, but unsuccessfully, and the idea of dirigibles disappeared by the late 1930s. These are the obstacles that ultimately led to the failure of the dirigible docking plan for the Empire State Building.
49	14882	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by @PERSON1, the builders of the Empire State Building were faced with a number of obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top. The greatest obstacle the builders faced was nature itself. @PERSON1 stated, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" therefore it wasn't safe for dirigibles to be docked there. The wind would cause them to swivel around the mast, and it would be unsafe for the builders to hang lead weights on the dirigibles because they would be dangling above the pedestrians on the street. The other obstacle which prevented dirigibles from mooring at the Empire State Building was due to the law against airships flying too low over urban areas or cities. This existing law made it illegal for dirigibles to ever tie up to the building or just approach it because the area was too low over the city. @PERSON1 said, ""although two dirigibles did attempt to reach the building before the entire idea was dropped."" @CAPS1 two dirigibles failed at getting close enough to tie up or to deliver there cargo safetly, because of the forceful winds and the non-existence of certain mooring equipment, which should've been installed to help secure the airships. Due to these combined obstacles, dirigibles were ultimately never able to moor successfully at the building."
50	14883	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted the builders of the Empire State Building endured many obstacles when trying to dock dirigibles. The idea of a mooring mast began when former governor of New York, Al Smith was determined to make the Empire State building the tallest in the world. When the Chrysler building became the tallest Smith was said to have announced, ""... The Empire State would now reach the height of 1,250 feet"" (Mooring Mast). Although many were enthusiastic about the plan, there were many obstacles before dirigibles docked there. The first problem was stability. If a thousand pound dirigible was connected to the building by one tether then it, ""... would add stress to the buildings frame"" (Mast), which would have made the builders completely alter the building's structure, a costly and time-consuming endeavor. Another reason was safety. At the time most foreign dirigibles used hydrogen, a highly flammable substance, instead of helium, which could be a great hazard considering all the people it could harm below, and the potential for a catastrophic explosion. However, the greatest obstacles for the dirigibles future was nature. Above the Empire State there were wild wind currents causing the back of the dirigible to swivel. When builders couldn't find a practical solution to all these obstacles, it was realized dirigibles would not be kept there for the safety of all New York City inhabitants, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the ambitious mooring mast project."
51	14884	6	3	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" written by @PERSON1, there were obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building were faced with that should have been apparent before they built the mast. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" It says in ""The Mooring Mast"" that at the top of the building winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making docking a dirigible a dangerous proposition. Also if the dirigibles were tethered, the back of them would move around while the dirigibles would also be high above the city with people watching, an inherently unsafe situation for passengers and onlookers alike. ""An existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" posed another significant problem. It's illegal for a ship to tie up with the building or to even go to an area like that, making the entire endeavor legally questionable. These things should have been brought to the builders’ attention, as obstacles such as nature and lawbreaking were clearly in play, suggesting a lack of foresight in the planning stages of the mooring mast."
52	14885	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a lot of obstacles. They needed to make plans that were very difficult. The Blimps and airplanes could crash into the building. It was too high, firstly. The builders needed to make long, difficult plans. They needed to make the right skeleton for the mast to fit the rest of the building and had to make changes to the existing plans to fit the mooring mast. Secondly, the Blimps and airplanes could cause an accident. Blimps fly about 80 miles per hour and they could approach the mast at a speed that is too fast and destroy it. Lastly, the mast was very high. It would be hard for blimps to reach the height of the mast. Irving Clavan said, ""... Such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date for the landing gears."" In conclusion, builders of the Empire State Building faced a lot of obstacles; the plans were difficult, the Blimps and airplanes could crash, and the mast height was too high, making the construction a truly remarkable feat of engineering."
53	14886	6	3	"Some of the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were mainly weather and safety. In paragraph 1 the author says ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". This means that because of the wind and air currents always shifting the dirigibles would be hard to control, making docking a difficult and potentially dangerous maneuver. Another obstacle they faced was safety. Also in paragraph 1 the author says ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights... where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street..."" What that means is having something heavy dangling above people is not a good idea. It wouldn't be a good idea because if the weight would of disconnected from the dirigibles there is a possibility that somebody could get injured badly, creating a significant liability and public safety concern. Those obstacles are what builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock, ultimately contributing to the abandonment of the plan due to the insurmountable challenges they presented."
54	14887	6	3	Thraghat The process of attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire state building the builders faced many obstacles. The first obstacle that the builders faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there occurred in the actual building process. Because the mast would add too much stress to the frame of the building if simply attached to its flat roof, the builders had to reconstruct the steel frame of the building in order to safely place the mast on top, a very expensive and time consuming project involving significant redesign. Another obstacle that the builders faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire state building had to do with nature itself. Because the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast which was very unsafe, presenting a significant hazard to both the airship and the building. The laws against airships flying too low over urban areas also proved to be an obstacle because the ships would never be able to actually approach the area. In conclusion, the builders faced many obstacles during construction for the dirigibles.
55	14888	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were, a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building’s frame. This presented an obstacle because workers would have faced a difficult and challenging situation working on the building with such a massive airship attached. Another obstacle was the wind pressure; securing a thousand-foot dirigible with only a single cable, especially in strong winds, undoubtedly posed a significant challenge. Furthermore, the extensive modifications, costing over sixty thousand dollars, that had to be made to the building's framework, clearly constituted a substantial obstacle, requiring considerable time and effort to complete the necessary structural alterations. These factors made the dirigible docking concept ultimately impractical.
56	14889	6	3	"In the excerpt, The Mooring mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the readers learn that there are obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph @NUM1, the readers learn that the architects were worried about the load of the blimp and the wind pressure that would be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, requiring them to strengthen and modify the Empire State Building. The architects also saw problems with foreign dirigibles which used hydrogen rather than helium as said in paragraph @NUM2, ""Most dirigibles from outside the U.S used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The risk of fire was a major concern. One of the biggest obstacles was how the winds on top of the building were always shifting, so even if the dirigible was tethered to the mast, the back would still swivel around, making passenger transfer difficult and dangerous. Ultimately, the architects' idea for a mooring mast disappeared, and it was then used for observation, proving the initial plan to be impractical due to a combination of structural, safety, and logistical concerns."
57	14890	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced some obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles dock there. Some of these obstacles had easy solutions, but some of them were really hard to solve. One obstacle they had was the dirigible on top of the building being hold by a cable tether only would cause stress to the building's frame. In order to solve this problem they needed to make modifications that would cost around six thousand dollars. This wasn't the only problem, there was a law that prohibited airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal to get close to this area or even try to get tie up to the building. Adding to this, the most difficult obstacle the architects faced was nature, and this problem was hard to solve and also hard to control because of the high winds and unpredictable weather conditions at that altitude. All this obstacles they faced lead them to give up for now & wait to see if later with more technology the could finally make this dream come true.
58	14891	6	3	"When they built the Empire State Building they faced obstacles building it. An obstacle they faced was that they wanted to make it as high and as safe as possible. The way the architetures wanted to make it the tallest building in the world was by putting a mooring mast on the top of the building. A mooring mast is basically a dock for dirigibles (blimps). This was dangerous, especially considering the winds at that altitude. It was because the Mast could snap at such a high altitude and plumate to the ground or snap, and dangle high above the street. ""... The Government people in washington are figuring on some way of mooring airships to this mast,"" says Al Smith four year term governor of New York. Although it may look nice, its not the safest idea, and the potential for disaster was a serious concern."
59	14892	6	3	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For one thing, the builders couldn't simply place a mast on top of the Empire State building, because the building would surely collapse. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the Empire State building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"". To change and fix this problem, over sixty thousand dollars would be needed for the modifications. Another obstacle the builder's failed to see was the actual construction of a modern-day dirigible. The dirigibles, ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly Flammable"". If the dirigibles were to ever explode while docking, the situation would have been horrible over a densely populated area of New York. Lastly, the greatest obstacle of the building was nature itself. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around"". this would be very dangerous. The dirigible could swing over pedestrians in the streets meaning it was not safe at all. These significant challenges ultimately proved insurmountable, revealing that docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building was an impractical endeavor."
60	14893	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted the builders faced obstacles such as how the dirigibles would stay tied to the mast. They weren't sure as to how they would keep the dirigible from swiveling from air currents. As said in paragraph @NUM1, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's framework."" The mooring system needed to be strong enough to withstand immense strain. Another problem faced was the use of hydrogen in the dirigibles made them highly flammable, posing a significant safety risk to the building and the surrounding area. These challenges required innovative engineering solutions to ensure the mooring mast's functionality and safety."
61	14894	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed. One of the problems that they faced was that many dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, posing a significant risk. This factor caused the owners of the Building to worry about the safety of the many civilians that lived in downtown New York. Another factor that the builders faced was that the winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This caused problems because in landing fields the blimps could be weighted down with lead weights but that could not be done at the Empire State Building; many dirigibles would not be able to reach the Building either due to the winds. One last factor that was faced is that it is against the law to have airships fly too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. All these factors caused the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and passengers to disappear, rendering the intended purpose unachievable and impractical.
62	14895	6	3	"In the short story ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon, there was an obstacle that the builders had to overcome. Building the top of the Empire State Building was difficult because the dock part of the tower wasn't stable. Also the frame of the building couldn't support the dirigible, ""dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame"". The designers designed a new tower that was a ""shinny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from the inside"". The winches and controlling machinery would be housed in the base of the shaft itself. They also added an observation deck and more passengers were able to wait for the dirigible. Ultimately, another problem was that there was a law that aircrafts couldn't get too close to urban places. Overall, it was a hard, painstaking design for them and cost a lot of money, representing a significant engineering challenge."
63	14896	6	3	"Despite Al Smith's goal of fulfilling the ""dream of aviation pioneers,"" the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One such problem that the builders faced was the stress a dirigible would add to the building itself; by mooring a large dirigible to the building by a single cable tether, the building would have to be able to withstand the stress of the dirigible itself and the wind pressure that would be transmitted throughout the entire building. Thus, the builders were forced to strengthen the frame of the Empire State Building with over $2 million of modifications. In addition, dirigibles from outside the United States posed as a danger hazard due to most of them being filled with highly flamable hydrogen. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, it became obvious of the risks of such an accident above a densely populated city of New York. Not only that, but the raging winds on top of the Empire State Building also posed a problem as even when tethered to the mooring mast, the rear of the ship would continually sway around the mooring mast; this proved to be a danger hazard with the citizens of New York directly below it. Furthermore, there was an established law prohibiting airships from flying to low over urban areas; this made it illegal for a dirigible to tether itself to the Empire State Building and further cemented the impossibility for the builders in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The combination of structural concerns, safety hazards, and legal restrictions ultimately rendered the dirigible docking plan unfeasible."
64	14897	6	3	"In @PERSON1's excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast,"" the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Although dirigibles were a modern form of transportation they were highly dangerous. As it states in paragraph @NUM1, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the U.S used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen in highly flammable."" This along with the ""violent air currents"" as stated in paragraph @NUM2, were two of the risks that the builders had to take into consideration. The builders needed to converse the idea of a safe way in which dirigibles could dock there insuring that no one gets hurt. Another obstacle the builders had to take into consideration was the law passed in which was, ""against airships flying to low over urban areas,"" as explained in paragraph @NUM3. This further complicated the docking procedure. The excerpt clearly explains the complications the builders had to endure and take into thought when constructing the Empire State Building. In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building underwent many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."
65	14898	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by John Tauranac, the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The greatest obstacle the builders had to overcome was the winds were constantly changing because of the air currents. Another reason why dirigibles weren't allowed to dock on the empire state building was because many dirigibles from outside the United States used Hydrogen which is very flammable. So if one blew up like it did in Lakehurst, New Jersey more people would be effected by it. Yet another reason why dirigibles weren't allowed to dock there is because they could use lead weights to weigh down the back of the blimp because that would be dangerous for the people below Another reason why dirigibles weren't allowed is because of the sharp spires of the other buildings in the area. If a Navy captain was afraid of having his blimp poped then no one should be allowed. The last reason was that there was a law saying that air ships can't fly too low over urban Areas. Those with the obstacles the builders could never overcome, concluding that the mooring mast plan was ultimately impractical."
66	14899	6	3	There are many obstacles that the builders face when creating the Empire State Building. First off, the height of the building came into question, and there were many discussions about the top of the building's design. The Empire State Building's initial goal was to be a futuristic city landmark, and they even considered mooring blimps to its peak. However, there was really no way to get the blimp steady enough to dock safely to the building, and the large aircraft were not supposed to fly too close to the building due to surrounding structures. In conclusion, they did face many problems during the construction of this iconic skyscraper.
67	14900	6	3	There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced. One of the greatest being safety. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, most dirigibles from outside of the U.S used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flamable, posing a significant risk in a densely populated urban environment. Also another issue was purposed in paragraph @NUM2, this was nature itself. The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered down, the back of of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast, making passenger transfer dangerous and impractical. Yet another obstacle as to the reason why dirigibles couldn't dock at the Empire State Building was in paragraph @NUM3, this was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This regulation further restricted the feasibility of dirigible docking. These obstacles made it nearly impossible for the Empire State Building to serve it's original purpose as a convenient airship terminal.
68	14901	6	3	The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. There were high, violent air currents causing the building to constantly shift. It was neither practical nor safe, ultimately rendering the ambitious project unusable due to uncontrollable environmental factors.
69	14902	6	3	There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building had to face while trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One reason is the dirigibles were unsafe. This is because dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen, which is extremely flammable. If the dirigible caught on fire in a densely populated place, then many people could die from it. Another obstacle the builders faced was nature itself. This is because the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting, so the back of the dirigible would swivel back and forth. They could only fix the problem by putting weights on the back of the ship, but to do that impractical and unsafe. This is because the weights would be dangling high above pedestrians, so if one broke, it could kill someone. The third obstacle is that there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, so it would be illegal for the ships to tie up to the building. The final obstacle was the wind could have pushed the ship onto sharp spires, which could puncture the ship, so the pilots wouldn't be able to get the mooring equipment attached properly. These are the obstacles the builders faced, which ultimately meant that the mooring equipment was never installed and the dirigible docking plan was abandoned.
70	14903	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Safety reasons, weather conditions, and government laws, defeated the purpose of the mooring mast on top of the building. For example, many of the dirigibles used at the time contained hydrogen instead of helium, ""hydrogen is highly flammable... above a densely populated area."" (@NUM1). The builders realized this was not smart, especially considering the potential for disaster in the heart of New York City. Furthermore, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting do to violent air currents."" (@NUM2) This created a dangerous situation because the ship would swing around the mast, making docking incredibly hazardous for both the airship and the building itself. Lastly, the most obvious obstacle was a government law prohibiting a ship to even approach the building. ""...an existing law against airships flyinging too low over urban areas"" .(@NUM3) effectively prevented any practical use of the mooring mast. The whole idea that was built up to something great had slowly dwindled, as the realities of safety and regulation made the dream impossible. The builders of the Empire State Building faced these obstacles, and many more, in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the airship docking concept."
71	14904	6	3	"In the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, many obstacles of building the Empire State building as a docking station for dirigibles are described. John Tauranac, the man who came up with the plan to dock dirigibles on the top of the Empire State Building forgot some very important things to take into account. First the entire building would have to be modified because ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"" (paragraph 1). The building's structure was not originally designed to endure such immense forces. The second problem that would need to be solved would be the safety of the city. Many ""dirigibles from outside United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (paragraph 2). If an accident like the German dirigible Hindenburg happened, it would be ten times worse, creating a catastrophic scenario in the heart of New York City. Lastly, the ""violent air currents"" (paragraph 3) would pose as one of the greatest obstacles. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles tried to tie up but could not get close enough because of ""forceful wind"" (paragraph 4). These unpredictable winds made the docking procedure incredibly dangerous and unreliable. The obstacles of making the Empire State Building into a mooring mast caused too many problems that could not be solved."
72	14905	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. Allowing dirigibles to dock on the top of a building had never been done before, presenting unique engineering challenges. They had to add over sixty thousand dollars worth of framework before they could even begin building the mast, a considerable expense at the time. Then, once the mast was designed, and the building had been framed to the 85th floor, the roof had to be completed before the mast could begin to be framed, adding another layer of complexity to the construction process. Overcoming these hurdles was essential to complete the building.
73	14906	6	3	"Builders had many problems with allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. First of all, in 1930 the author explains that ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would only add stress to the building's frame"". Builders with that would have to construct the building to make it more stable. Also, there were cases that outside the United States they use Hydrogen other than helium. Hydrogen is very flammable, and because New York is so populated it would not be safe to pedestrians. This flammability concern, coupled with the structural challenges, meant the seemingly simple idea presented significant hurdles. Seeing this, you can tell that builders had too many problems coming from such an ""easy"" thing."
74	14907	6	3	"The obstacles on allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building were far too great, something that should have been obvious before construction started. One major reason was safety. Most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is very flammable. The tragic ""Hindenburg"" accident in Lakehurst, New Jersey, dramatically highlighted this danger, and the idea was quickly shot down. Another reason why it just didn't work was the strong wind currents at the top of the Empire State building. Winds would have been too great for dirigibles to safely and reliably dock. Moreover, there was already a law about Airships flying too low over urban areas. A dirigible approaching the building would have likely violated this airspace restriction, rendering the entire concept impractical and illegal. Thus, all these factors ended the idea before it could proceed far."
75	14908	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph @NUM1, the excerpt tells the reader of a huge issue. It states, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of a building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building frame."" Due to this, over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework to reinforce it against the immense strain. Another set back is in paragraph @NUM2. It states, ""The greatest obstacle... was nature itself."" Due to violent air currents high above the city, the back of the ship would swivel violently around the mooring mast, making docking incredibly dangerous. Tethering the mooring mast with additional cables would do little to help stabilize the massive airship. Lead weights could not be used to try and keep the dirigible steady. In paragraph @NUM2, it states, ""dangling weights high above pedestrians..., was neither practical nor safe."" All of these obstacles showed architects that the project, at that time, was effectively impossible to execute safely and reliably."
76	14909	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. In the excerpt it said ""the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to fail."" A somehow unseen obstacle was the fact that ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium,"" which is a much more unstable gas, and if a dirigible caught fire and went down over New York, many civilians would be killed or wounded. This presented a significant safety hazard that was difficult to mitigate. Another obstacle the builders faced was ""the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting."" This would make it very difficult to anchor a dirigible down to the mast, and as the excerpt said, they could not use lead weights hanging from the underside of the dirigible because they would be hanging over citizens below, posing a serious risk. Considering these factors, the impracticality and danger surrounding the mooring mast ultimately contributed to its disuse and the failure of the original vision."
77	14910	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles. These obstacles were not easily fixed. First, the steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the ""new situation,"" specifically the increased height and weight it needed to support. Another obstacle was safety. Having an accident would be detrimental to many peoples' lives, because it is located in such a densely populated area, requiring careful planning and execution of construction tasks. Also, the winds made the whole thing very dangerous, requiring specialized equipment and worker training. Lastly, there was an existing law saying that airships could not fly too low over urban areas, impacting the original plan to use the spire as a mooring mast for airships; this ultimately necessitated design changes. These challenges demanded innovative solutions and careful consideration, ultimately contributing to the iconic building we know today."
78	14911	6	3	"The obstacles that the builders @CAPS1 face in attempting to allow dirigibles is making its speed go up. Another obstacle that the builders @CAPS1 is the landing area, ensuring adequate space and infrastructure. The last obstacle that the builders @CAPS1 is making sure that the passengers get on and off safely. Like it says on paragraph six, ""passengers could safely get on and off the dirigible by walking down a gangplank..."" demonstrating one possible solution for passenger safety. Overcoming these obstacles is crucial for the successful implementation of dirigible travel."
79	14912	6	3	"There were plenty of problems engineers at the Empire State Building faced when they wanted to dock dirigibles. Well for starters, the winds up that high were overpowering, as it says in paragraph @NUM1 ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Also there was the dirigibles themselves that caused a problem, for they were filled with hydrogen, which is very flammable. One other problem was air laws; they state that dirigibles, in urban areas, were not to fly too low. These regulations, combined with the flammable nature of the airships and the dangerous winds, made the entire endeavor too risky. It is because of these problems that destroyed Al Smith's idea that building could dock airships."
80	14913	6	3	"With any public transportation unit, many challengers are expected and some are problems unable to be solved. Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, builders of the Empire State Building faced plenty of obstacles in attempts to allow dirigibles, or blimps, to dock there. In regards to docking these dirigibles, they were breaking ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" which made the builders' procedure illegal and raised concerns about legal ramifications. Also, not only was it a danger for the citizens of New York City, but due to the weather conditions it was dangerous for passengers and workers on the dirigible, adding substantial risk to the entire operation. L¸sted states that ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This inherent unpredictability underscores the impracticality of the endeavor. This goes to show that any project should be checked for safety precautions at all times, highlighting the importance of thorough planning and risk assessment before implementation."
81	14914	6	3	Al Smith's dream of having airships dock atop the Empire State Building was cut short by bitter reality. The idea failed partially due to the impracticality of docking a 800 foot balloon filled with flamable gas to a city building. The mere size of this glimpse was astounding and this created many problems. Firstly The wind atop a skyscrapper is great and inconsitent. It is extremely difficult to dock to a building a seen when the Los Angeles tried to dock in 1932. The balloon was unable to dock due to potential damage it could cause to itself and the surrounding city. The blimps were also kept afloat by Hydrogen which due to its chemical nature is extremly flamable. Blimps had exploded in the past such as the Hindenburg. Engineers knew that if a similar accident occurred at the Empire state Building, substantial damage would have been done to the city and building itself. These impracticalities combined with the use of airplanes rather than blimps gaurenteed no blimps would ever be docked to the Empire State Building.
82	14915	6	3	Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast. One of which being that most dirigibles outside the U.S. used Hydrogen to float, making them very flammable and unsafe. The highly flammable nature of hydrogen posed a significant risk; if a blimp were to be damaged over New York, many people could be hurt due to potential explosions. Also, nature itself made docking extremely difficult. High altitude winds buffeting the skyscraper made the blimps very unstable and difficult to control. If one were tied to the mast, winds could wrap the mooring line around the mast, potentially causing structural damage or tearing the airship. Another obstacle was the existing law that prohibited aircrafts from flying that low over urban areas. This made it illegal for any ship to even approach the mast, rendering the docking plan impractical from a legal standpoint. These safety and legal concerns ultimately made the ambitious dirigible docking plan unfeasible.
83	14916	6	3	Al Smith and his team of builders faced several obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building. The first problem with docking dirigibles is that the steel frame and foundation could not support the stress put on it by a dirigible attached to it, especially considering the immense weight and pull a large airship would exert. Also, when the builders looked back on past dirigible accidents like the Hindenburg, they realized that if an accident were to occur, many lives would be at stake, not just for those on the dirigible, but also for those in the building and on the streets below. Furthermore, there were laws that limited how low a dirigible could fly over urban areas, so it would be illegal for a dirigible to dock at the Empire State Building because it would be too low, violating established air space regulations. Finally, and according to the builders, most importantly, the largest problem with docking dirigibles to the Empire State Building was mother nature. Winds at the top of the building were very high and changed unpredictably, effectively turning the dirigible docked into a disaster waiting to happen, making any attempt at docking both impractical and dangerous. Thus, a combination of structural limitations, safety concerns, legal restrictions, and unpredictable weather ultimately made the dirigible docking plan unfeasible.
84	14917	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in an attempt to allow dirigibles to dock; this included not being able to put a mooring mast at the top of the building in fear that because the dirigible was being held by a ""single cable"" it ""would add stress to the buildings frame."" With the amount the dirigible weighed and the wind, the building's frame would not be strong enough and would have to be ""modified and strengthened,"" which would have added significant costs to the project. Another obstacle in attempting to get the dirigibles to dock was the wind. The building was high up, the wind currents were volatile and ""constantly shifting;"" in result, the back of the dirigibles ""would swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" making docking incredibly difficult and dangerous. A further obstacle faced by the builders was that they were trying to build the mooring mast in an urban area with other buildings close by; the dirigible could be pierced and would also be dangerous for the pedestrians in the city below, ultimately making the concept impractical."
85	14918	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building were faced with multiple problems for their idea in for what the building would be used for. The first problem for the builders came up about the building's frame. A thousand-foot dirigible at the top of the building held by only one cable would cause too much stress to the building's frame. The load of the dirigible and the wind would have to go to the building's foundation, which was much too far below. The building would have to be modified, costing over sixty thousand dollars in modifications, just to support the airship mooring. The architects made changes to the building to fit these needs. But again, the architects were presented with a problem. The mast of the building would cause problems that should have been spotted by the architects way before construction, with the biggest problem having to do with safety issues. Most dirigibles outside the country used hydrogen, which is highly flammable, and the risk of fire was substantial. There already had been an explosion; one over New York could be too much, especially considering the height and density of the surrounding city. Therefore, the impracticality and danger ultimately led to the abandonment of the dirigible docking idea.
86	14919	6	3	In order to allow dirigibles to dock on the roof of the Empire State Building, the workers would have to go through a series of tasks such as, strengthening the steel frame, and designing a sturdy mast. If the frame were not strong enough, then the building would simply collapse under the immense weight and stress. More than sixty thousand dollars was spent on restructuring the frame to withstand the additional load. Also, with high-speed winds at that altitude, the mast would have to be incredibly sturdy and engineered to rotate, otherwise the dirigible would not stay in one place and could potentially damage the building. After the Hindenburg disaster, people realized how unsafe these dirigibles really were, and so the idea was found not only unsafe but also impractical and eventually deemed illegal due to safety concerns. In conclusion, not a single blimp would ever be docked, nor will one ever, atop the Empire State Building.
87	14920	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. Firstly, the thousand foot dirigible would attach to the buildings by a single cable, adding stress to the frame of the building. The builders were forced to modify and strengthen the foundation to address the issue of stability. Similarly, builders had to deal with the issue of wind pressure which were constantly shifting at heights of over 1000 feet in the air. The load of the dirigible swinging in the breeze would transmit pressure and stress onto the buildings foundation. This was a high safety concern, and pivotal to the decision that dirigibles could not dock at the empire state building. Lastly, builders were forced to face the law against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for dirigibles to even attempt to land on the mooring mast. The builders faced significant obstacles such as building weakness, safety, and law enforcement, that made attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State's mooring mast, virtually impossible.
88	14921	6	3	"In The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Al Smith wanted to add a ""top"" or a ""hat"" to the Empire State Building that would function as a docking station for dirigibles. The dream was not ment to be. The first of many problems was getting the mooring mast, docking station, on top of the building. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" A dirigible would only be held by one cable. The dirigible's load and the wind presure would have to be transmitted all the way down the building. There were also safety problems. A lot of dirigibles used hydrogen, a gas known for its buoyancy. Hydrogen is highly flammable. It is also very windy around the Empire State Building. The dirigibles would have to hang sandbags by ropes for balance. These would hang above the people below, posing a significant risk. The mooring mast was a good idea, but the builders faced to many problems. The project was never completed because the challenges proved insurmountable."
89	14922	6	3	"Though in theory the idea of the mooring mast seemed attainable, in reality there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. An initial problem was faced during the process of adding the mooring mast to the building. As stated in the article: ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. ... The steel frame... would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation."" This modification, necessary to overcome the obstacle of attaching the mooring mast consumed over $500 thousand dollars and much time and effort. A second obstacle which interfered immensely with safety was ""nature itself."" The violent winds at the top of the building would cause tethered dirigibles to ""swivel around and around"" the mooring mast. Dirigibles moored in airfields could be weighted down by lead weights, but this idea could not be executed because ""... using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe."" These significant engineering and safety concerns ultimately proved insurmountable. Such problems as these created many obstacles for the builders of the Empire State Building, ultimately rendering the mooring mast concept impractical."
90	14923	6	3	In this excerpt, the builders faced many obstacles with the Empire State Building in attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some of those problems included weather, height, and the gases used to to fuel the dirigible. The weather was a tough force to beat. If the dirigibles were to dock at the building, the wind at that height was more extreme, and could cause the dirigible to swerve, making docking incredibly difficult and dangerous. The next contributing factor was height. In the excerpt, it stated that law ordered a limit. If the dirigibles were too low to urban areas, it would be unsafe. At any moment something could cause the dirigible to fall and crash on buildings and pedestrians, posing a significant risk to the city below. The last obstacle is the type of gas used. Apparently hydrogen is highly flammable compared to helium, and a leak could easily ignite with devastating consequences, which could also cause harm to the passengers. In conclusion, weather, height, and the type of gas used, were all among the many obstacles that the Empire State Building would face when allowing dirigibles to dock there, ultimately contributing to the abandonment of the ambitious plan.
91	14924	6	3	"The architects of the Empire State building believed that dirigibles were able to dock on the building if there was a mooring mast. However there were many obstacles to over-come to allow this to happen. If a dirigible landed on the mast, it would force a lot of pressure on the building as it swayed in the wind. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored... would add stress to the buildings frame."" And as nature played a role, the wind could swing the body of the dirigible possibly causing the frame of the building to break and the building to collapse, making the entire venture far too risky. Another obstacle that the architects faced was danger. American dirigibles used helium, while dirigibles from other countries used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. ""... the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey..."" The architects realized that they Hindenburg explosion would have been worst if it occurred on the Empire State building ""... above a densely populated area..."", leading them to reconsider the practicality and safety of the mooring mast concept altogether. Ultimately, the risks associated with wind pressure and potential explosions proved to be insurmountable, causing the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan."
92	14925	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring @CAPS1"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, there were many problems with adding a dirigible dock at the top. One obstacle was the safety of the dirigible, as ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly inflammable"" (@NUM1), raising concerns about potential explosions. Nature itself posed another challenge: ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@NUM2), making docking maneuvers extremely difficult and risky. The existing law against airships flying too low over cities further complicated matters. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (@NUM3), thus creating a legal barrier. These issues highlight the complex reasons why establishing a dirigible dock presented such significant hurdles."
93	14926	6	3	"Through the excerpt The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, we learned that the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the summit of the building. Some of the obstacles that the builders faced in this engineering challenge are; @CAPS1 the builders faced the challenge of how the Empire State Building was going to be able to support the weight of these long aircrafts. We learned this in paragraph @NUM1 when the author states ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building... would add stress to the buildings frame."" To overcome this problem ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened (@NUM2)."" It is later said that these modifications would cost over sixty thousand dollars, a considerable sum at the time. Another problem that the builders faced was, how safe docking a blimp would be in a highly populated area. In paragraph @NUM3 we learned that most dirigibles are made of hydrogen, which is highly flammable. After ""the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey... The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" This potential for disaster added a significant layer of concern to the already complex engineering problem. All in all in the excerpt The Mooring Mast we learned that the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the peak of the building, ultimately leading to the abandonment of this ambitious plan due to safety concerns and financial considerations."
94	14927	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building could not dock dirigibles because of the building's structure, the winds pushing the dirigibles, and public safety. The structure could not handle the swaying dirigible because of the winds pushing the back side. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used Hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This quote shows how dangerous it would be to put a large flammable dirigible over New York and the people in New York, considering the potential for disaster given the volatile nature of hydrogen. This ultimately made the ambitious dirigible docking plan impractical and unsafe."
95	14928	6	3	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon *Lusted*, explained why there is a landing area on the Empire State Building called the Mooring Mast. The first obstacle the workers faced was there was no landing space on the top of the Empire State Building. This means dirigibles could *not land* at all. To fix the problem of not having a landing area, they would add the Mooring Mast. The Mooring Mast was built with wenches that would hold the dirigibles but it would put too much stress on the building. The workers used a *large amount* of money to make the building so it wasn't stressed when the dirigibles was held to the Mooring Mast. After all that got fixed they forgot one thing, the wind. The wind was so violent that the dirigible couldn't maneuver to get on top of the Empire State Building. When the workers figured that out they gave up. Marcia Amidon *Lusted* explained what the workers tried to do to get a dirigible to *land* on the Empire State Building in the excerpt The Mooring Mast.
96	14929	6	3	Most of the obsticles the builders of the Empire State Building had were due to weather. If New York ever had a windy day the dirigible would pull at the mast. The mast is attached to the **skeleton** of the building, and it might affect the frames or **structure** of the building. Another reason is the danger it would bring to all of New York. If a dirigible ever hit something or something went wrong the dirigible would **crash** on top of New York. With all the trafic of New York you would most likly not want a burning dirigible falling overhead. Therefore, the Empire State Building faced significant challenges related to weather and potential accidents.
97	14930	6	3	Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders could not simply just drop a mooring mast on the roof because that would add stress to the building's frame. Another problem that faced the builders was that hydrogen, used to keep dirigibles afloat, is very flammable. If a dirigible had caught on fire and exploded over downtown New York, then lawsuits would be made. Another problem that faced the builders in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building were the winds at the top of the building, shifting due to violent air currents, which would make docking extremely difficult. The last obstacle was the fact that there was a law against aircraft flying too low over urban areas, making the entire endeavor legally challenging. Because of these numerous issues, the plan to dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building was ultimately abandoned.
98	14931	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obsticales in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was the height and alltitude of the Zeppelin, creating significant challenges. Even if they docked, the back of it would be moving around everywhere from the wind, making passenger transfer dangerous. Another reason was that on May 6, 1937, the Hindenburg was burned to the ground after takeoff, witch means that it was very flamable from using hydrogen instead of helium. All raised safty issues that needed to be sought out, effectively ending the dirigible docking concept.
99	14932	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Dirigibles were long; some were as long as one thousand feet. Dirigibles were docked by an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front to the back. The architects could not drop a mooring mast on top of the building because a one thousand-foot dirigible held by only a single winch would be too heavy for the building's frame. In order for it to work, the framework would have to be strengthened to accommodate the one thousand foot dirigibles. This would be a process worth over sixty thousand dollars, just for the framework. Another obstacle was safety, as dirigibles out of the United States did not contain helium but hydrogen, meaning they were highly flammable. If an accident were to occur like in Lakehurst, New Jersey then a lot more people would be harmed considering downtown New York was densely populated. These obstacles made for the builders of the Empire State building prove that it was not a good idea to dock dirigibles.
100	14933	6	3	The builders faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. One was that they had to find a way that would not make the building too unstable; a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building would add stress to the building's frame. Another obstacle was that the winds would be too strong and not safe for the dirigible to be up there; the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. A third example would be that it was too dangerous to have the dirigible up there because the gases within were extremely flammable; most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The final obstacle the builders would have to face was that there is a law that does not allow airships to come too close to the ground in urban areas. So in conclusion, we can see that even though it was a good idea to port dirigibles, it was not a practical one.
101	14934	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem they faced was redesigning the building's original skeleton to fit the needs of the mooring mast. This can be shown when the excerpt states, ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"" (paragraph @NUM1). The workers had to change their first design to meet the mandatory requirements for the mooring mast. The workers also had to face the fact that overall, the mooring mast was too dangerous to use. This can be proven when the excerpt says, ""The greatest reason was one of safety... hydrogen is highly flammable"" (paragraph @NUM2). The dirigibles used outside of the United States used a gas that created a dangerous risk for accidents; a single spark could ignite the entire airship. Another battle the builders had to face was the strong winds. This can be shown when the excerpt quotes, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"" (paragraph @NUM3). The winds caused the dirigible to move too much that it became unsafe to use, making the docking procedure far too risky for passengers and crew. The builders of the Empire State Building were challenged with many obstacles while they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there."
102	14935	6	3	There were many different obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles. For example, the wind on top of the building was constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making it incredibly difficult to control the massive airships. Because of the unpredictable weather itself, it caused them to determine that they could not safely build the mooring mast. Another reason is that using the Empire State Building where passengers would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe. The risk of equipment failure or accidents could easily kill people that were roaming around. Lastly, they could not moor at the Empire State Building because there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. These challenges ultimately proved insurmountable, leading to the abandonment of the dirigible mooring plan.
103	14936	6	3	During the construction of the mooring mast atop the Empire State Building the builders faced several obstacles. The greatest obstacle was Nature. The winds at this height are shifting too frequently, causing the dirigible to be tossed around the mast, making it unsafe to board, especially with the cumbersome docking procedures envisioned. Another obstacle was how they weighed dirigibles down with lead weights. Having lead weights at this height was risky because they could plummet down upon the people below, causing severe injury or even death. The third obstacle was a law against the airships flying too low in urban areas. This made it impossible for any dirigible to dock or even come near the Empire State Building without violating air space regulations. These obstacles forced the builders to shelf the mooring mast construction, rendering it a mere decorative feature.
104	14937	6	3	"Obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were some of the following. They needed an exact way of getting everything perfect for the job. The whole building process for this job was very complicated and needed the best expertise. In paragraph @NUM1, Al Smith's quote greatly backs up my point. He says ""one set of engineers here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement and the Government people in Washington are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to the mast"". It tells just how much people were working on this job to ensure its success, and the scale of the collaboration involved. In conclusion, this was a complicated job. They weren't positive if the mast would even be able to stay, nor were they sure if the fluids inside would be but a problem factor."
105	14938	6	3	"In the piece ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, it describes what the mast on the Empire State Building was really for. There were many obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to moor on the mast. One problem they faced was that the dirigible landed on the roof would add stress to the building's frame. The stress and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the foundation of the building, which would require considerable reinforcement. This means the building would have to be modified and strengthened. Safety was also a big issue for the mast. Because the dirigibles used hydrogen, it could catch on fire and be destroyed over a densely populated area. Another obstacle was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting. This made the back of the ship swivel around, making mooring difficult and dangerous. Lastly, it was not successful is because of the law against airships flying too low. Before the constructors built all this extra to the building they should have thought of all the defects it could have, ultimately rendering the mooring mast concept impractical and unrealized."
106	14939	6	3	Al Smith was a very competitive person: one of the challenges Al had to go through is competing with another building, and he had to make his building taller than the Chrysler building, which, in 1930, if he didn't make his building taller, he would have lost the title of the tallest building in New York.
107	14940	6	3	"Although the idea for turning the mast at the top of the Empire State building into a docking area for dirigibles was a highly clever idea, it was not a very safe one at all. One reason why dirigibles could not moor the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law rendered the mast idea a failure before construction began, a fact seemingly unnoticed by the workers. Another obstacle that added difficulty to the construction was how much pressure having the dirigibles moored to the building added to the base of the building. This caused another significant amount of money to be spent trying to fix this problem. A third factor that made the idea of setting up a mast even more difficult came straight from nature itself. The winds that high off the ground made maneuvering the dirigible in such a small space very difficult. This was proven when ""In December 1930, the U.S Navy Dirigible 'Los Angeles' approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" Ultimately, the combination of legal restrictions, structural challenges, and adverse weather conditions made the dirigible mooring concept for the Empire State Building impractical and unsafe."
108	14941	6	3	There are many things in life that seem like they could be brilliant ideas but, in reality there are many flaws with it. One of these ideas is using the Empire State building as a mooring mast for dirigibles. This is what Al Smith, the governor of New York at the time, discovers in an excerpt from The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted. In this excerpt the builders of the Empire State building had to face some serious obstacles to allow the docking of dirigibles: building the Empire State building many of the blue prints had to be changed. One thing that had to be changed was the skeleton of the building. They needed a way to support the drigibles if they were to dock. The skeleton they had in place put too much stress on the top half of the building that it would result in breaking. Another thing that the builders had to deal with was the safety of the people. If the highly flamable helium inside the dirigibles then it would be putting thousands of peoples lives in jeopardy. Finally the builders had to deal with the violently shifting winds. This too put stress on the frame of the building since the winds were so strong there and also a fear that it would blow the blimp into the pointed mast and break the blimp. Overall there are many reasons why the Mooring Mast never became a reality.
109	14942	6	3	The idea of docking dirigibles on top of The Empire State Building was a grand one. It seems as though the dream of dirigible transportation was on its way up, however, the architects were blinded by their excitement. Al Smith's competitive nature not only pushed the building to an un-precedented 1,250 ft., but also combined transportation in new, fashionable, and effective ways. This not only made the public and architects excited, but also put a lot of expectations on the building. Al Smith did not see all the obstacles ahead that would halt his dirigible plans. One of the obstacles being that the swaying of the dirigible would add stress to the frame of the building, though the necessary precautions were made, the obstacle was foreshadowing the others to come. Besides structural concerns, the high winds at that altitude also presented significant challenges. When the dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire due to the hydrogen gas, people became skepticle. What if it were to blow up over a crowded New York city street? Also, an existing law against aircrafts flying too low over urban areas prohibited the dirigible plans. The obstacles proved too much for the plan to go through. Though the plans were merely postponed by the late 1930's the idea of dirigibles a top the Empire State Building had disappeared, fading from public memory as air travel evolved in different directions.
110	14943	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in attempting to allow dirigible to dock there. The builders of the Empire State Building failed to realized that building the mast would create too many problems and safety risks. Without thinking about the obstacles, the mooring mast also had problem on its own anyways. According to the excerpt, one of its greatest obstacle was ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This resulted to being a problem because the dirigible could go anywhere, not landing in the mast properly and cause damage. With this problem also came risks for pedestrians who are on the streets. The dirigibles ""...could be weighted down in the back with lead weights"" because it used open landing fields. This was not a good idea to be using these at the Empire State Building. Another thing builders should have considered was that there was a law in place already that is ""...against airships flying too low over urban areas."" All in all, there were alot of things that builders should have considered before attempting to allow dirigible to dock there. Ultimately, the combination of unpredictable winds, outdated landing techniques, and existing aviation laws made the prospect of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building impractical and ultimately, a failed venture."
111	14944	6	3	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" written by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One main problem was that the architects could not just drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof. There needed to be modifications made to make it safe for a dirigible to land there, a feat requiring significant engineering ingenuity. The biggest obstacle was nature. L¸sted said it best in paragraph @NUM1, ""The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This unpredictable movement posed a serious safety risk. The final problem the builders faced was, even if they did manage to figure out a way to put the mooring mast up, there was still a law stating dirigibles illegal to land there. L¸sted said in paragraph @NUM2, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."" This legal hurdle presented a definitive roadblock. Obviously, from the examples given, the builders of the Empire State building had faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, rendering the mooring mast concept ultimately impractical."
112	14945	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced were weather-related. Nature itself would ruin the time frame of building. Winds would shift, and even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. Another challenge the builders ran into was that dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building because there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, rendering the initial plan for airship docking unfeasible. These unforeseen challenges underscore the complexities involved in constructing such an iconic structure.
113	14946	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced many challenges in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring at the top of the building. The main challenge was caused by nature itself. The winds above the building were constantly blowing and shifting direction. This would cause any dirigible attempting to dock swing around and below in the wind, which poses many safety risks for passengers going on and off the zeppelin. The dirigible could also puncture its frame on nearby buildings while attempting to dock, which also causes safety risks for people on the building and on the ground. Having a zeppelin attached to the building also made it structurally unstable, and modifications had to be made to the frame of the building to give it more support, including reinforcing the mooring mast itself. In the end, the idea was dropped because it would never work and was unrealistic, proving to be an impractical solution for transatlantic air travel.
114	14947	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced difficulties while trying to dock dirigibles. One obstacle was nature. At the top of the building, the winds were constantly changing because of violent air currents. This would make a ship swivel around dangerously. Even if it was tied, the back would move. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of ship with swivel."" Another obstacle was safety. Foreign ships used hydrogen, an extremely flammable gas. In fields, they used lead weights to weigh down the airships. If an accident happened with either, it would be extremely fatal. ""Dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION1 use hydrogen... is highly flammable."" ""Could be weighted down by lead weights, but using these at the Empire State building, where they would be hanging high above pedestrians on the street,"" a flaming dirigible or falling metal object at extreme heights would cause serious injuries because the landing site was above a highly populated city. Furthermore, a law forbade ships to fly in low urban areas so, even if the mooring system worked, it couldn't be used legally. These combined challenges led to the quiet disappearance of the dirigible mooring idea in the late 1930s, as the practicalities and safety concerns proved insurmountable."
115	14948	6	3	"Throughout the passage, the builders were faced with many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. Al Smith had the idea to have dirigibles be a new form of transportation. The idea sounded great with the dirigibles moving at a rate of seventy-five miles per hour and moving thousands of feet without needing to be refueled. Anxious, Al Smith was very unsure of when the project would all be done, saying, ""it's on the level, all right. No kidding. We're working on the thing now."" It would just not be possible for the architect to drop the huge mooring mass on top of the building's flat roof because it was too heavy. Another problem would be the violent wind currents at that height, making docking dangerous. Ultimately, the fate of the dirigible as a primary mode of passenger transport faded out. Airplanes became more suitable to passengers than dirigibles, spelling the end of the Empire State Building's dirigible ambitions."
116	14949	6	3	Based on the excerpt I just read these are some of the obstacles that the @ORGANIZATION1 faced; one of the obstacles was the balloon because it had helium and was also flammable. The second obstacle is that you can't control the balloon, and the third obstacle The Empire State Building had was a flat roof, and these are the obstacles that the @ORGANIZATION1 encountered, thus highlighting the challenges faced.
117	14950	6	3	There were several obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem they faced was they would have to change & fix the structure of the Building in order to compensate for all the Stress there would be on the Building when the dirigibles landed. After they constructed & built the landing, there were several more problems. The first problem was that the hydrogen in the balloons is very flammable. This is a problem because New York is densely populated & with a flammable substance above there heads, it poses a threat. The second problem was the dirigible itself. It can easily blow in the wind, & would constantly wave in the wind, & unlike in a field, weights cold not be tied to the back of it because of the crowds below. The third & final problem they dealt with was the law: airships are not allowed too fly low over urban areas. The Empire State Building was too low in an urban area for anything to fly over it. Several of these problems led to the failure of the original idea & left the Empire State Building with a tall post of no purpose.
118	14951	6	3	"Dirigibles also known today as Blimps used to dock at the empire state building. The Empire State building was used as a docking ground for dirigibles (which are enormous steel formed balloons filled with hydrogen and helium, which made them lighter then air). They had a top speed of @NUM1 mph for thousands of miles. ""Al Smith saw an opportunity for the empire state building: A moor added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers on and off."" As stated in the excerpt. The dirigibles were docked by an electric winch which stopped the big balloon from going anywhere and tied it to the mast. Al Smith's vision included the potential for quick transatlantic travel, making the Empire State Building a central hub. Ultimately, however, Al Smith was not successful when building moore cause it was good for dirigibles, and it proved too dangerous with the high winds and downdrafts around the skyscraper, thus ending the experiment."
119	14952	6	3	Some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, was that it wouldn't be able to tie a cable tether, because it adds stress to the building's frame. Also in the story they tell you how the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation, requiring further engineering considerations and potentially adding to the project's overall cost and timeline.
120	14953	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" many of the builders faced obstacles for attempting dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. Many of the reasons had to do with safety. Although the idea to dock dirigibles to the building sounded good many things could have gone wrong. The Empire State Building was an enormous structure for its time, even though it looked ideal for the mast to go on, winds would be too dangerous for even the most skilled pilots to maneuver the dirigibles. Also most of the dirigibles from other countries such as Germany used hydrogen in their blimps. Although the dirigibles were hailed as the transportation of the future, too many safety precautions had to be taken because of the densely populated area of New York City. For the dirigibles at the time they were a sound and good idea for transportation, but even though the structure of the Empire State Building looked good they still had to be careful with the building and the people below, and for the German hydrogen filled blimps were not good terms of safety over a populated city. Ultimately, the safety concerns surrounding dirigible docking proved insurmountable, leading to the abandonment of the mooring mast concept."
121	14954	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there. One being the changes in wind current. The dirigibles did have steering systems, and could be tethered however the wind could overpower these systems causing it to lose control and crash. Another obstacle was the fear of another ""Hindenburg"" accident. On May 6, 1937, the Hindenburg, a dirigible that, like all other dirigibles of that era, contained hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, was ignited and burned down, keeping the casualties mainly to the men and women on board; however, if this incident happened above the highly populated New York City, the number of deaths would increase drastically due to the pedestrians below being caught in the ensuing inferno. Therefore, the dangers were deemed too high to continue with the docking plan."
122	14955	6	3	Some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are safety and nature. Safety was an obstacle because most dirigibles from outside the U.S. used hydrogen instead of helium, and because hydrogen is flammable, it was not safe at all. It could have caught fire, just like the Hindenburg caught fire in 1937, so the owners of the Empire State Building saw how unsafe it was for the public and the building itself. Nature is another obstacle because the wind currents on the top of the building kept shifting because of violent air currents, making docking extremely difficult and hazardous. These safety and environmental challenges ultimately made the dirigible docking plan impractical.
123	14956	6	3	"Although high expectations were conceived for the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, as explained in the excerpt from The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1. The dream of having a mooring mast to dock new airships was quickly halted when architects first discovered the stress that a dirigible, held by a single cable tether, would add to the building's fame. As a result, ""the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would...be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation...nearly eleven hundred feet below"" (paragraph @NUM1). Consequently, architects had to reinforce the building's framework to accommodate the tremendous amounts of stress this docking procedure would cause. Secondly, the owners of the Empire State Building found that a law concerning airships became an obstacle as well. Stating that airships could not fly too low over populated urban areas, the law became another practical reason why dirigibles could not moor atop the miraculous building, effectively grounding the initial vision. Finally, architects had also discovered the greatest obstacle to their success to be nature itself. The winds atop the building were described to be violent, forceful and unpredictable, presenting a serious safety concern. As a result, mooring dirigibles to the mast ""where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe"" (paragraph @NUM2). Moreover, the violent winds made it difficult for dirigibles to approach the mooring mast in the first place. In December 1930, the captain of the U.S. Navy dirigible ""Los Angeles"" feared that ""the wind would blow the dirigible into the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell"" (paragraph @NUM3). In effect, the idea of using the mooring mast to dock dirigibles atop the Empire State Building quietly disappeared, deemed too risky and impractical. As described by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 in the excerpt from The Mooring Mast, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there, ultimately leading to the abandonment of this ambitious concept."
124	14957	6	3	The Top of the Empire State Building would be more than ornamental, more than a spire or dome or a pyramid but there to add a desired few feet to the height of the building or to mask less than ideal features. This intentional design decision served a dual purpose, both achieving a specific height and subtly improving the overall aesthetic.
125	14958	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were that most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Another reason was the wind. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Such conditions would not only make docking incredibly difficult, but also make it unsafe for the pedestrians below the Empire State Building should any accident occur, thus rendering the entire concept impractical.
126	14959	6	3	"In Marcia Amidon L¸sted excerpt The Mooring Mast, is about the empire state that was built to being the tallest building. There are copious of ways of the builders faced attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In the excerpt it states, ""Most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium (hydrogen is more flammable)"". This highlights the danger, proving how it's likely to destroy the whole entire empire state with Fire. Another issue that portrays how builders faced attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there when it states, ""Dangling high above pedestrians on the street was practical nor safe"". This emphasizes the safty of the people walking on the street and what if they get hurt. Finally another obstacle that portrays the builders faced when it states, ""... blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings"". This proves if the dirigibles blow the empire it's not the only building in danger others around it too, thus illustrating the infeasibility of the mooring mast concept and the safety hazards involved."
127	14960	6	3	"In the nonfiction article The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted it gives information of the potential problems from the Mast. In the article section titled **Height of Ambition** it says ""The steel Frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened."" This shows that at first the building was not strong enough to hold such weight. Another problem was nature. The workers had to take nature into effect; weather conditions could cause issues. If they had a dirigible or a blimp up there the wind could potentially harm the dirigible. There was also a law in place that for bid aircraft to fly that low. Finally, workers had to make the height exceed any other height that was taller. In the article section titled **A Race to the Sky** it says ""In December 11, 1929, he announced that the Empire... would reach 1,250 feet..."" John Tauranac also followed by saying ""Their top they said would serve a highe calling."" The builders had a lot to take in to effect they had height issues, frame and law issues that they had to sort out. All of these complications show the difficult task the builders of the Empire State Building faced."
128	14961	6	3	In the novel, The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, obsticals of the Empire State Building faced to attempemt to allow dirigibles to dock there were enginering challenges. A problem with the docking was that the building was complete before the idea came to mind. A second problem was that the whole skeletal structure had to be changed in order for dirigibles to be able to dock. Then the question on how the airships, dirigibles, would stay next to the building arose, particularly regarding the mooring process itself. These were harder problem after it was illigale to have dirigibles to be close to buildings as well. Plus the fact that if they crash they are flamable and could kill people, posing a significant safety hazard. These are some facts that made it difficult for the Empire State building to build a dirigibles docks in the novel, The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon L¸sted.
129	14962	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon, there is an obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. This idea would not work because the dirigibles are too heavy, and that would cause more pressure towards the Empire State Building. When there is a massive amount of pressure on the building, it would be at risk. ""The dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" This immense weight and force posed a significant engineering challenge. Another obstacle was the expense of the construction. ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" This considerable sum highlighted the financial impracticality of the project. Furthermore, New York is densely populated, and space is limited. There isn't any space that is big enough for the dock. ""Some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City."" The sheer size of the dirigibles made finding a suitable docking location within the city nearly impossible. These are the main obstacles that ultimately prevented the Empire State Building from serving as a dirigible dock."
130	14963	6	3	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to let dirigibles dock there. One obstacle they faced was that the building's frame would have to be modified. This was because the dirigible would add stress to the frame of the building when docked on it. These modifications would cost over sixty thousand dollars, a significant sum at the time. Another obstacle the builders faced was that it would be too difficult to keep the dirigibles still. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This made it dangerous for passengers as well as pedestrians on the street and prevented the dirigible from getting close enough to tie up. A third obstacle the builders faced was that there was an existing law that said airships could not fly too low over urban areas because it was very dangerous. Although it seemed like a good idea, there were too many obstacles and dangers involved in letting dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building, ultimately making the venture impractical."
131	14964	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the most apparent problems was its urban area with a lot of pedestrians walking the street. They didn't want dirigibles flying so close overhead without knowing what was going to happen, fearing potential accidents. Another thing was that the German dirigible, the Hindenburg, had been destroyed by fire. They had to think about how much worse that could have been if it was on the mooring mast, possibly killing people and completely destroying the building. Also, they had to consider how much more construction and money it would take for the Empire State Building to hold a dirigible. There were many problems they didn't think about in the process, which is why the mooring mast wasn't successful as planned, ultimately proving to be an impractical endeavor.
132	14965	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was that a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable, would add significant stress to the building's frame. Therefore, in order to strengthen the frame to withstand such forces, it would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Another challenge was the combined stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure acting upon it, potentially creating dangerous conditions. The last obstacle was safety, because if an accident took place high above downtown New York, the consequences would be devastating. Ultimately, these significant challenges and safety concerns led to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan.
133	14966	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The @CAPS1 Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle that the builders faced was safety. In paragraph @NUM1, it was said that ""most dirigibles from outside of the @CAPS2 used hydrogen rather than helium"", now hydrogen is highly flammable and posed a significant risk in the bustling city. In paragraph @NUM2, it states that ""if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around"", now that's neither practical nor safe, especially given the strong winds at that altitude. If the ship is tied, the back should be stable to allow for safe passenger transfer. The last obstacle that the builders faced was a law against airships flying too low. In paragraph @NUM3, it applies that ""this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"", essentially making the entire docking plan impossible from a legal standpoint. Though some ships did attempt to reach the building, the high winds and legal restrictions ensured there was no success in that endeavor. Ultimately, these safety concerns and legal limitations prevented the Empire State Building from ever serving as a functional dirigible docking station."
134	14967	6	3	When the idea of making a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building was thought of, builders did not realize the obstacles that would have to be passed. One obstacle was nature itself. The winds, on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This means that if a dirigible were to be tied up for loading and unloading, it could be moved around freely in the sky, making it dangerous for passengers to be on or around it. An example of the dangerous winds would be in 1930, the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. A concern for safety was that most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If something wrong were to happen, there could be great consequences for the heavily populated downtown of New York City. A third and final obstacle that occurred was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. Because of these obstacles, the idea to have dirigibles dock at the top of the Empire State Building seemed impossible, and was never accomplished.
135	14968	6	3	Now, people know what a ludacris idea it was to have dirigibles dock on top of the Empire State Building; however, in the 1920's and 1930's people were oblivious to the idea, many failures, and the obstacles the builders would face. One obstacle that was faced was that most of these dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, which is extremely flammable and put the city at risk of potential explosions. Another obstacle was nature; due to the high winds on top of the Empire State Building, it was hard to bring the dirigibles remotely close to the mooring mast. Yet another obstacle facing the builders of the mast was a law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas like New York City, limiting their approach. Overall, the idea could not be projected into a real-life, visual interpretation because of the obstacles faced by the builders of the mast; now people have airplanes and airports to dock the planes - there's no use for the mast on top of the Empire State Building regarding aviation.
136	14969	6	3	Builders had to face obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The biggest obstacle is that it is unsafe to have it dangling over the city and thousands of pedestrians. The dirigibles would be held by a single cable tether and that would add a lot of stress on the building's frame. Another big obstacle they faced was nature; the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making docking a hazardous endeavor. Over @MONEY1 would be needed for this to happen, considering the significant engineering challenges and safety measures required to overcome these issues. Ultimately, the combination of safety concerns, structural limitations, and unpredictable weather conditions presented a formidable challenge to realizing this ambitious vision.
137	14970	6	3	"Allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building caused many obstacles. One of these obstacles was that dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Using hydrogen was highly flamable. They knew how dangerous it was. In the excerpt it says, ""The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. Another obstacle people had to deal with was nature. In the excerpt, it says that air currents were ""violent"" and it would be very hard to control the dirigible. Finally, dirigibles mooring at the Empire State Building would be illegal. It says, ""An existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" Thus the dirigibles could not dock over a heavy populated city like New York City. Many obstacles made it challenging to dock dirigibles on the Empire State Building."
138	14971	6	3	"In building the dirigible docks on the Empire State Building, builders faced an onslaught of problems that should have been easy to pick up on. Everyone got caught up in the hype in my opinion. Outside of the U.S., other dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable, instead of helium. After the Hindenburg disaster, ""... the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Winds also played an obstacle in the construction. ""... the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" The dirigibles would not be able to tie to the dock and stay because of violent air currents. There was a law holding airships from flying too low in urban areas. ""The law would make it illegal for air ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area...,"". Finally, times changed and planes became the new fad for air transport, ending dirigibles run as the main provider. Ultimately, the impracticality and safety concerns surrounding dirigibles made the Empire State Building's docking station a doomed venture from the start."
139	14972	6	3	"The builders ran into quite a few problems when they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. As stated in paragraph @NUM1 ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium; and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This would mean that if a docked dirigible filled with hydrogen were to catch on fire it would burn down the Empire State Building and much of the city, killing many people with its explosion. Another main obstacle, as stated in paragraph @NUM2, was nature: ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These winds would make it almost impossible for a dirigible to reach the mast and actually dock, and the dirigible would be swinging around violently once it was tied to the mast. The third major problem was the law against aircraft flying low over urban areas as stated in paragraph @NUM3: ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" With the law in the way, no one would even want to try docking. Therefore, due to the flammability of hydrogen, dangerous wind conditions, and legal restrictions, the dirigible docking plan was ultimately impractical."
140	14973	6	3	The Empire State Building builders had to face hard obstacles by accommodating passengers, establishing new routes, and the greatest obstacle was to nature itself. By accommodating the passengers, they had to bring them to the existing transatlantic routes, since the new routes weren't established yet. This was in part because the building needed to be taller, so they added more to the top. They wanted the State Building to withstand violent air currents. The dirigible was more suited for open fields to moor, but the State Building was weighted down by lead weights to help provide greater stability. Ultimately, overcoming these obstacles was crucial to the building's success.
141	14974	6	3	There were a few obstacles the builders faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One was the violently changing wind currents at the height the docking was to take place. These unpredictable gusts would move the blimp and possibly send it careening into another building, puncturing the side of the balloon. Dirigible after dirigible being docked would put a lot of stress on the building itself. The repeated strain could disrupt the frame and possibly affect the structural integrity of the building as a whole. Also, most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium for lift. Hydrogen is highly flammable, as tragically demonstrated in the Hindenburg disaster, posing a significant fire risk to the skyscraper and the city. Due to all these considerable reasons, the mooring mast never saw a docked blimp, and the grand vision of airborne passenger transfer ultimately remained unrealized.
142	14975	6	3	"According to the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, engineers faced several obstacles when they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock in the Empire State Building. As stated in paragraph number nine, a key problem was ""the stress of the dirigible's load."" With all this weight being transmitted to the building's foundation, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate its new situation. This was very expensive to do; sixty thousand dollars were necessary. Another problem was that the blimps would not stay still while docked; the winds would toss them around. A solution involved putting weights at the back of the landing fields, but the weights ""would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street"" as explained in paragraph ten. These challenges, especially the structural modifications and safety concerns, ultimately contributed to the impracticality of the mooring mast concept."
143	14976	6	3	"When building the Empire State Building, builders were faced with several obstacles in their attempts to have dirigibles dock there. The builders first had to ensure that the building was going to be able to support the dirigible. After they completed this, issues relating to safety arose. It was very dangerous because some air balloons were made out of hydrogen, which was flammable. If there were any issues, New York's population could be in grave danger. The wind also was an issue, because it was so shifty a dirigible would be heavy in the back. Dangling above New York was very dangerous. The last complication that affected the idea of docking the dirigibles was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" Because of the law, safety, and natural complications, builders were never able to successfully reach their goal of allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, thus ending the prospect of aerial commuting to the iconic skyscraper."
144	14977	6	3	"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, had many obstacles of the construction of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The author states ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" That law essentially made it illegal for a ship to approach the area and to get tied up to the building. Another obstacle was the lack of landing area; it was a challenge to expand in New York City, causing it hard to land dirigibles in the confined space. The greatest obstacle was nature itself, the weather would cause the dirigibles to swivel around the mooring mast, especially with strong winds. The author states, ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights... dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" This impracticality and safety concern ultimately made the mooring mast concept unfeasible."
145	14978	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many difficulties in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One difficulty they faced was when they were designing the mast. They ""could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof..."" because it ""would add stress to the building's frame"". This was a difficulty because the Empire State Building's frame had to be modified and strengthened to accommodate it, resulting in significant modifications. Another difficulty faced by the builders was in regards to nature. As dirigibles use ""hydrogen instead of helium"", there was a great risk of fire; always a problem above New York City. The wind was also a problem. The winds on top of the building were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". The back of the ship would have to be weighed down by lead; again, not feasible in New York City. A final difficulty the builders faced were existing air laws. The builders' faced the issue of existing law against airships ""flying too low over urban areas."" This made it ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" Some of the many difficulties faced by builders of the Empire State Building were mast designs, nature and existing air flights laws, ultimately contributing to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan."
146	14979	6	3	Some of the problems they faced building the Empire State Building was the height. Building a building that high up and also expecting it to do things such as boarding dirigibles presented unique challenges. The impact of the dirigible against the building could cause it to collapse. That's why the contractor had to reshape the skeleton of the building, ultimately ensuring structural integrity and safety.
147	14980	6	3	"In the passage, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, there were a lot of conflicts that the builders ran into while trying to let the dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building. One problem was safety. Unlike regular balloons, dirigibles were made of hydrogen, a lighter-than-air gas that made them buoyant. Hydrogen is highly flamable, presenting a significant fire risk. This would have been a problem if it was above people on the street and the building, potentially causing a catastrophic explosion. Another problem was nature. The winds, where they would have docked, would have been way to strong. As the passage says ""the winds on top of the building were constanly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@NUM1). These unpredictable gusts made it nearly impossible to safely moor the large airships. One last reason is because there was a law against aircrafts from fly to close to neiborhoods. All and all the dirigibles ran into a lot of problems, making the idea of docking them at the Empire State Building ultimately impractical and unfeasible."
148	14981	6	3	"Al Smith, a former governor of New York had a brilliant idea to make the Empire State Building the tallest building in the world. He would put a mooring mast on the top to **allow** dirigibles to the top so the dirigibles could let passengers off here. But, this plan had many **issues**. ""The stress of the dirigible's load into the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"". This is a problem because if the mast was just placed on the building, it would destroy itself. Another problem is that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen."" Hydrogen is a very flammable gas, and would put the whole section of the city underneath the Zeppelin at risk. The third reason was an existing law which prevented airships from flying too low in urban areas, making the entire concept impractical and ultimately unworkable."
149	14982	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Airship Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, many obstacles are described from the construction of the Empire State Building in New York City. Thousands of dollars were spent on hopeless modifications to the building, in efforts to add a mooring mast to the top for the docking of dirigibles, or blimps. These efforts however were unsuccessful. Two main obstacles builders faced during construction were safety in nature. After a 1937 dirigible fire in New Jersey, owners of the Empire State Building ""...realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" (Lusted, 2015) and an existing law forbade low airships in urban areas. Also, the unpredictable winds provided workers with a very risky, dangerous situation. In the end, although builders faced many obstacles during construction, dirigibles were never docked on the building."
150	14983	6	3	The Empire State Building faced several major problems in making a station for dirigibles to dock. One is that at that time there was a law prohibiting airships of any kind landing/docking in a residential area, never mind a densely populated city. There were also many issues with practicalities with the mast, if it was even constructed. It would have been a huge hassle to get the huge airships docked, and keeping them there, never mind the extremely flammable hydrogen gas zeppelins were often filled with, making the entire endeavor incredibly risky and ultimately impractical.
151	14984	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were for many different reasons. One of them is the weather; ""the greatest obstacle to successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" making docking a dangerous proposition. The second one is that they had a law against airships; there ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" further complicating the logistics. The problem was also that the dirigible would be dangling high above people reads, ""...they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe,"" posing a significant risk to those below. These are some of the problems that they had to consider, ultimately contributing to the impracticality of the ambitious airship docking plan."
152	14985	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building had to face the obstacle of safety, to make sure everyone could get on the dirigible safely without any form of danger. Another obstacle was arranging the dirigibles so that they were able to board passengers from there. @PERSON1 said ""the height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gears."" People didn't want to try it, so that would be another obstacle. If people didn't want to try it then it would become just a decoration, and that's not what Al Smith wanted. The last obstacle would be that it wouldn't hold for long as said in the excerpt ""The mooring mast on the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" Essentially, the architects didn't think far enough ahead into the future to see if the mooring mast would even be used. These are some of the obstacles that the builders had to face in their ambitious endeavor."
153	14986	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while constructing a mast that would make it possible for dirigibles to dock. The greatest obstacle of all was nature itself. It was unrealistic to have a dirigible tied by a single cable tether to remain intact when the winds on top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents. These air currents were unpredictable and would cause the massive airships to be difficult to manage. The back of the ship would swivel around the mast which was hazardous for pedestrians walking below. There was nothing the builders could do to alter nature so their ideas soon became unrealistic and deemed impractical. Another obstacle the builders faced while constructing the building was that the dirigible's weight would add too much stress (especially with added wind pressure) to the building's frame. They then decided the only way to fix that problem was to shift the weight to the building's foundation, but that would involve costly and complex structural changes. Ultimately, the challenges proved insurmountable, leading to the abandonment of the dirigible docking concept.
154	14987	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was attaching a mooring mast to the top of the building. Because of the height of the Empire State Building, they were unable to just drop the mast onto the roof, for that would have interfered with the building's overall frame. In order to keep the mooring mast atop the roof, the architects spent thousands of dollars on modifying the framework of the building. Another obstacle for the docking of dirigibles was the preservation of the safety of the public below. Dirigibles were inflated with highly flammable hydrogen, creating the risk of a massive explosion over New York and endangering countless lives. Lastly, a very important obstacle for the builders was the danger of nature. Violent air currents filled the winds above and around the Empire State Building. Even if a dirigible were strung to the roof, the back of the ship would continue to swivel, causing even more danger to citizens below the building. These significant challenges ultimately prevented the successful creation of a mooring mast and the realization of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
155	14988	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the frame of the building. In *Darling, C. (2007). Empire State Building*. @LOCATION1, @NUM1, it explains that attaching a dirigible to the building would add stress to the building's frame. They had to modify the whole frame of the building to a stronger material for the mooring mast to work. One of the biggest obstacles was safety. Most dirigibles use hydrogen to power them, and hydrogen is highly flammable. There is a great risk of the dirigibles to catch on fire when flying over such a densely populated area as New York. Another obstacle in the way of the mooring mast was the conditions at the top of the building. At the top of the Empire State Building, there are violent winds that would cause the dirigibles to swivel around the mooring mast. Lastly, An obstacle the builders faced was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. As explained in *Darling, C. (2007). Empire State Building*. @LOCATION1, because of this law, it is illegal to even fly up to the Empire State building. With all of these obstacles, it is clear why the mooring mast wasn't used.
156	14989	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced some problems while trying to allow the dirigibles to dock there. They couldn't just allow the dirigibles to land on the building's flat roof, because it weighed too much and would add stress to the building's frame. The plan never followed through for a few reasons. A big issue was safety, especially concerning the highly flammable hydrogen used to keep the dirigibles afloat. This highly flammable substance was too dangerous to use above New York. The greatest issue was the wind. It was always changing because of air currents around the tall building, making maneuvering difficult. The dirigible could be tethered down, but it would be floating in the air above pedestrians, posing a significant risk. Therefore, the ambitious plan to build a mooring mast on the Empire State Building to allow dirigibles to dock there was ultimately a failure due to practical and safety concerns.
157	14990	6	3	"While building the Empire State Building, Al Smith believed he had solved the problems of dirigibles having no where to land. However, having the building as a place for dirigibles to dock proved to be much harder than it seemed. First, the balloon would cause too much stress to the building's frame. The author states, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation..."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). Also, because this frame would need to be modified, a lot of money would need to be spent. The author states, ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This large sum highlighted the financial impracticality. It was too risky to invest on such an unsure project. Also, they realized how dangerous any accidents could be over such a populated area. The author explains, ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used Hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@CAPS1 @NUM3). The potential for disaster was simply too great. If anything had happened, a very large part of New York could have suffered. Although the plan of creating a mast for dirigibles was impressive, it was neither logical financially, or logical for saftey reasons."
158	14991	6	3	During the Building of the Mast, the builders faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The primary obstacle was the building itself. By adding the mast, lots of stress would be added to the building's frame, and therefore strengthening modifications had to take place before the mast was erected to support the added weight. Another problem was how to tether the Blimp properly since they are generally landed in wide open fields which allowed for weights to be placed in the front and back of the blimp, ensuring they could be secured properly. But since the blimp was going to be attached to a mast, there was no way to secure the back of the blimp and therefore no safe way to tie the blimp down, as it left the aircraft vulnerable to pivoting around the mast. And finally, the last problem builders faced was how to even get the blimp docked. Since there were such high winds on top of the building, there was no feasible way to dock the blimp unless it was perfect weather, which was a rare occurrence. Ultimately, all those problems made it so the mast could never be used for its intended purpose.
159	14992	6	3	Many obstacles stood in the way of docking the dirigibles on the Empire State Building. One obstacle the builders faced was the law stating airships couldn't fly too low over urban areas, which would make maneuvering close to the building difficult. Also, the builders would have to reinforce parts of the building to support the stress the dirigibles would place on the frame during the docking procedure. Lastly, nature would not allow the dirigibles to be safely docked due to the fact the violent winds at that altitude would shift the back of the dirigible making it sway wildly and making it unsafe for passengers. These obstacles made sure that dirigibles could not be docked at the Empire State Building, rendering the intended airship mooring mast impractical.
160	14993	6	3	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were considerable: the dirigibles would add stress to the frame of the building, potentially compromising its structural integrity. Furthermore, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this additional stress. Over sixty thousand dollars were needed to modify the apex of the building to even begin to facilitate such a docking procedure. However, the greatest obstacle was nature itself because the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making docking a dangerous, if not impossible, task. These were some of the obstacles that ultimately prevented the Empire State Building from becoming a functional dirigible port.
161	14994	6	3	"The obstacles that builders faced in making the Empire State Building a docking point reached the greatest problems. Obstacles come in all forms, depending on the size of the goal. The goal's size was immense so the range was in its greatest. The problems were law, nature, safety, and the point of docking. Firstly, the main problem was the location. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" This would have not only tore down the entire building but send it crashing down onto pedestrians within the range of eleven hundred feet it the direction it was hauled. Secondly, instead of helium, dirigibles used hydrogen instead, ""and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The airships would be extremely close to the city and its inhabitants. This put a safety issue, especially over a highly populated urban area, like New York. Thirdly, the building was so high, it intercepted higher forces of wind. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This could have made a dirigibles strain against the building or fresh against the mooring point. Lastly, law prevented all ""airships flying too low over urban areas."" As high as the Empire State Building was it was too close the public. Overall, the builders were impacient and that created obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. They made the goal so large, it caused the obstacles to reach their range of difficulty. The purpose of the Empire State Building may be a failure, but it still is the tallest building constructed."
162	14995	6	3	"In the short story, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when building the mask. The entire steel frame of the Building would have had to be strengthened to hold the weight of the mast. The mast, which towered at over 200 feet tall, would have stressed the steel frame of the Building, making its foundation weaker. To hold the mast, ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" This meant that the builders had to really think through the process of how they were going to get the mast to not bend the steel frame, requiring careful planning and execution. Another obstacle the builders faced was a new law that forbid airships from flying too low over urban areas, such as New York. Therefore, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the Building or even approach the area."" Because of this law, the mast was very rarely used, rendering it almost obsolete despite the effort put into its construction. Regardless of what they tried, the builders would have to make big changes to the Empire State Building's framework in order to have the mast. However, the new law prevented airships from docking there, so the mast was not used as often as originally projected. The mast did help make the Empire State Building the largest building in the world at 1,250 feet, but it forced strengthening and fixing of the building's framework, and the mask was not used as much as the builders thought."
163	14996	6	3	"The builders came across many obstacles while trying to build the Empire State Building for dirigibles to dock. One obstacle was just having ""... a single cable tether,"" which they went on to say would add stress to the building, so they had to fix that. They chose to modify the frame and strengthen it as well. Another obstacle was having to get the right equipment; they had to get some information from the @ORGANIZATION2 air station. The last obstacle would be that the dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, not helium. This meant it was very flammable, which was something they had to consider when creating safety protocols. While trying to make this work for the dirigibles, they came across building problems, safety concerns, and dangerous problems, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan due to these significant challenges."
164	14997	6	3	When the Empire State building was built the workers were trying to find new ways to **improve** the structure. They had suddenly found some problems with one being the top of the Empire State Building. Workers had tried to figure out how they were going to put Dirigibles on top of the building so that they could be able to pick up people and to drop them off up there, but there were different problems, ultimately making the plan impractical and eventually abandoned.
165	14998	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building's mast were confronted with many obstacles to overcome. Firstly, the builders had to compensate for the stress a docked airship would place on the building. According to @CAPS1, ""the stress... would be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" As a result, the building's steel frame would need to be modified to accommodate the load of the massive airships. Another obstacle faced by the builders were the weather conditions at that height: ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Any airship attempting to dock there would be violently buffeted around by the wind, making the docking procedure extremely difficult and dangerous. Finally, there was the obstacle of safety. As @CAPS1 states, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is extremely flammable."" The possibility @CAPS3 of a Hindenburg-type accident over a densely populated area gave pause to the builders, due to the catastrophic consequences that could ensue. In conclusion, the builders had to face several huge obstacles, which combined eventually doomed the project."
166	14999	6	3	In order for the Empire State Building to dock dirigibles (blimps), many obstacles had to be overcome by the architects. One of those obstacles was the Empire State Building's frame. If a thousand-foot dirigible was moored on top of the building with just a single cable tether, it would add tremendous stress to the foundation of the building due to the dirigibles load and wind pressure, potentially compromising the structural integrity. Another obstacle that the architects faced was safety. Because dirigibles in the 1930s used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, instead of helium, there was a high risk of the dirigible exploding, and threatening the dense population of downtown New York City. Possibly the greatest obstacle that the architects had to face was high winds. On top of the Empire State Building, the winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if lead weights could be used to weigh down and control the docked dirigible, they would still be unsafely dangling about the pedestrians of the streets below, posing a significant safety hazard. Those are some obstacles that the architects of the Empire State Building faced in an attempt to dock dirigibles, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the ambitious plan.
167	15000	6	3	"In the passage, ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon, a myriad of obstacles had faced the builders of the Empire State Building in terms of allowing dirigibles to dock there. First was the problem of constructing a mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof. Because, ""a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame,"" the building would be unable to support the stress of both the dirigible and wind pressure. The structural integrity of the building was paramount, and the dirigible's immense size presented a significant challenge. Next, safety became an issue. After the discovery that, ""most dirigible's built outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"", owners of the Empire State Building realized the hazard involved when having a highly flammable object fly over a densely populated area. This was brought to their attention when a German dirigible was destroyed by a fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. This disaster highlighted the potential for catastrophic consequences. An addition problem was nature itself. The winds on top of the building posed the problem of having the dirigibles back end swivel around the mooring mast, seeing as weights could not be used to weight the back down since they would be dangling above pedestrians on the street. Controlling the movement of the massive airships in such unpredictable conditions proved to be a substantial hurdle. Lastly, there was, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" it would be illegal for a Ship to be tied up to the building or approach the area. Navigating the legal framework surrounding airship operations further complicated the docking proposition. In light of the aforementioned reasons, it is evident that the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, ultimately rendering the ambitious mooring mast project impractical."
168	15001	6	3	"Ambitious for its time, the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building was doomed from the start. The engineers and builders of the mooring mast were faced with many obstacles that could potentially inhibit safe docking at the top of the building. The first major obstacle was finding a way to tether the dirigible to the dock. As described in paragraph @NUM1, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held on by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" The sheer weight and size of the airship, combined with movement, would place undue strain. Modifications would have to be made to the entire building. Another obstacle the engineers were faced with was stabilizing the dirigible once it was tethered to the building. As described in paragraph @NUM2, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would make it nearly impossible for passengers and crew to get on or off the dirigible, as the gangplank would be in constant motion and difficult to manage. These obstacles baffled engineers and builders of the Empire State Building until the project was abandoned entirely."
169	15002	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were many and at the end the dock could not happen. One obstacle was that the building's foundation had to be modified. In the story it says, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" This presented a major engineering challenge. Being so high, the dock would be moved around because of the winds, making docking incredibly dangerous. Also, the blimp itself could not even attach itself to the dock because the winds wouldn't let it, further complicating the process. In the end, the dock wasn't meant to happen; it came with a lot of problems for the builders and even the architects, proving ultimately impractical due to a combination of structural and meteorological factors."
170	15003	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted there are many obstacles that the builders stumble across. Many people would have a hard time with creating the docs for the dirigibles for the Empire State Building. One major obstacle that the builders had was ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" This presented a significant challenge in integrating the airships into the city's transportation infrastructure. Another obstacle that they could come across is that the dirigibles could take too long to fuel up and could cause a jam with other dirigibles, potentially disrupting schedules and creating logistical nightmares. Even though they had this huge obstacle they managed to get their way and they found a way to actually use the dirigibles without any types of problems, ultimately demonstrating their ingenuity in overcoming these considerable hurdles and making the mooring mast a reality."
171	15004	6	3	"In Marcia Amidon Lusted's ""The Mooring Mast,"" she describes the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Three of the main obstacles they faced were the lack of a suitable landing area, the necessity of reconstructing the building's framework, and a law against it. Dirigibles are enormous steel-framed balloons with envelopes of cotton fabric, filled with hydrogen and helium for lift. Being so large, some over one thousand feet, there was really no place for them to land. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building’s flat roof; it would add too much stress to the building’s frame"" (paragraph 1). Another obstacle was the considerable expense of over sixty thousand dollars to reinforce the building's framework just so it could support a dirigible. A third obstacle was the legal restriction against airships flying too low over urban areas. So even with a landing area and the structural reinforcement, they couldn't use it due to the law. Ultimately, the idea of a dirigible dock on the Empire State Building was thwarted because the lack of a suitable landing area, the costly reconstruction of the framework, and the prohibitive law proved too great for the builders to overcome."
172	15005	6	3	There were obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A practical reason why was a law against airships flying too close over urban areas like New York. The law would make it illegal for a dirigible to even approach the building, effectively blocking the docking idea. The greater reason was the issue of safety. If a ship came in to dock with use of hydrogen (a highly flammable gas), an explosion is possible, harming everyone below. The greatest obstacle were the shifting winds from air currents around the massive structure. Even if tethered down, the ship would swivel around the tower, potentially getting tangled and causing structural damage. In conclusion, the impractical idea had to be dropped, though a few smaller ships have reportedly tried to dock there.
173	15006	6	3	"I've been to the Empire State Building before, right up to the top. The top was not opened, but several windows were, and the thing that still stays with me is how amazingly windy it is up there. Trying to park a blimp on top of the building would be like trying to park a car in a flood, impossible. I was waiting for that factor to come up in the whole story, and it finally did: ""The winds on top of the building work constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). In addition to parking the blimp, the passengers would have to get off on a swaying gang-plank, which would not be too fun, or safe for that matter. Another problem they faced was the law. There was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). I would think that before spending @MONEY1 on an already unrealistic project, they would at least have made sure they were cleared law-wise, or at least considered the legal implications. When I read this essay, it seems the project was doomed from the start, both practically and legally."
174	15007	6	3	In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing area. So Al Smith thought putting a mooring mast at the top of the building, would allow dirigibles to dock there several hours. It would allow the dirigibles to refuel or get serviced and let passengers on and off. Another obstacle would be how the dirigible would be moored, as engineers worried about the structural impact. It would be held by a single cable tether, which would add stress to the frame of the building. The stress of the load and wind pressure would have to be transferred all the way to the foundation of the building, which was about eleven hundred feet below. Third obstacle would be the type of gas used to keep the dirigible afloat, either hydrogen or helium. If they used hydrogen it is highly flammable, and the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire. These challenges ultimately proved too difficult to overcome, and the mooring mast idea was abandoned. Those are some of the obstacles the builders had to face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.
175	15008	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted talks about The Mooring Mast or also known as the Empire State Building of how it was built and the original purposes of the building. During the making of the Empire State Building, builders faced issues in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there such as architectural problems, different gases, and the law. The builders faced a problem with the architect of building. The roof top was a flat as it says ""the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" That meant the heavy dirigible would add stress to the building's frame and potentially compromise its structural integrity. Another issue they faced was the gas some dirigible used; dirigibles were filled with different gases and ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than Helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" It meant that the building could catch on fire and whole downtown New York, posing an unacceptable safety risk. They also faced an issue with the law saying ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". It explains it would be illegal to tie a dirigible on the building, rendering the mooring mast concept impractical and ultimately unfeasible."
176	15009	6	3	"The excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted explains the construction of the Empire State Building in New York. The excerpt explains the steps of building the building as well is the obstacles and challenges that the builder faced. The architects of building the Empire State Building attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there, did not take into account the problems that may come with taking on such a large project. The creator of this plan to build a docking mast on the Empire State Building was Al Smith. Al Smith was so excited to build the mast, that he did not think about the complications associated with his ""master"" plan. Because of the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure, it was necessary for the building's frame to be strengthened which costed over sixty thousand dollars. The greatest obstacle for the builders was a matter of safety, as most dirigibles use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen was known to be very flammable, which would create a potential disaster over a densely populated area such as downtown New York. Another obstacle was nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, which would make docking incredibly dangerous. Also there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, further complicating the practicality of the mooring mast. Ultimately, the dirigible docking plan was abandoned due to these challenges. This excerpt shows that before you leap on a large challenge, you should look and take into account obstacles that may come with that."
177	15010	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were accidents over densely populated areas and violent air currents constantly shifting, making the entire endeavor ultimately impractical and unsafe.
178	15011	6	3	"The idea to put a mast on top of the empire building seemed like a brilliant idea. People thought it would be a great idea to dock a dirigible on the mast, especially because ""New York City was lacking suitable landing areas."" But it is easy to see how the mooring mast would never be able to dock dirigibles. One reason this could never happen is because most of these dirigibles contained hydrogen in them which is highly flammable. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey.... the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been."" Many people would die if this happened over a highly populated area. Another reason that the mast would never be able to be used is because there was, ""an existing law against airships flying too low or over urban areas."" So even if everything was set up correctly they would be breaking the law flying their dirigibles so close to the city. But the most obvious reason is that the weather would be too unpredictable above the Empire State Building. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due violent air currents."" Ultimately, the mooring mast would just be a totally unstable place to dock these dirigibles, rendering the initial idea impractical and unsafe."
179	15012	6	3	"In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the architects faced many problems. One of these problems was the building's frame. The frame needed to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new mast and the immense weight and forces involved. Another huge obstacle was safety. In paragraph @NUM1 the author states, ""hydrogen is highly flammable."" If a dirigible were to go up in @CAPS1 not only the passengers would be in danger but everybody on the crowded streets below. The winds at such a high altitude also posed a threat. Paragraph @NUM2 explains that the violent air currents would cause the back of the ship to swivel all over the place, making it hard for passengers to unload and creating a perilous situation for both the dirigible and the building. These were just some of the many problems builders faced while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building."
180	15013	6	3	The builders had wanted dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building. They found that they couldn't do that because the winds at that height would push the dirigibles in all different directions, making docking too dangerous. And also, there was a law that aircraft had to be a certain height in the air, further complicating the already challenging logistical considerations. Consequently, the dirigible docking plan was abandoned.
181	15014	6	3	When the Empire State Building was conceived, it was planned as the world's tallest building, taller even than the new Chrysler Building that was being constructed at forty-second Street and Lexington Avenue in New York. The top of the Empire State Building be more than ornamental, more than a spire or dome or a pyramid; it was intended to serve a practical purpose. The age of dirigibles was in its ascendancy, capturing the imagination of the public. The navy was the leader in the research and development of dirigibles in the United States, and the architects envisioned a mooring mast for these airships. However, the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof because structural integrity and safety had to be considered. Once the archietects had designed the mooring Mast and made changes to the existing plans for the building's skeleton, the stage was set for the building to potentially usher in a new era of aerial transportation. Ultimately, the impracticality of docking dirigibles to such a tall structure in the heart of Manhattan proved to be a challenge too great to overcome, and the mooring mast idea was eventually abandoned, though it remains an interesting footnote in the building's history.
182	15015	6	3	The obstacles the builders fact was that they could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. The Steel Frame of the Empire state Building would have to be modified and Strengthened to accommodate this new situation. The greatest reason was safety: most dirigibles from outside of the united states used Hydrogen rather than helium, and Hydrogen is highly flammable, posing a significant fire risk. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, exacerbating docking difficulties. The back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. existing law against airships flying too low. These factors ultimately made the dirigible mooring concept impractical and unsafe.
183	15016	6	3	Some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced were the high altitude winds, which posed a challenge to workers and materials alike, the laws that initially envisioned the building as a mooring mast for airships, yet later restricted them from being so close to an urban area, the safety of the passengers attempting to disembark from these airships, and the safety of the pedestrians below, who were at risk from falling debris during construction. These challenges required innovative solutions and careful planning to ensure the project's successful completion.
184	15017	6	3	The building was big and beatiful, its facade gleaming under the afternoon sun.
185	15018	6	3	It was unrealistic and also unsafe of engineers to think that they could have dirigibles dock on the building. One major problem with the idea is that the dirigible would add significant stress to the building's frame. Also, the sheer weight of the dirigible, combined with unpredictable wind pressure at that height, would cause a major problem for the foundation. Another thing is that dirigibles were made up of hydrogen, which is highly flammable; a single spark could have ignited the gas, and if one of the airships exploded, it would have been a disaster for downtown New York. This is why the idea is neither practical nor safe and was ultimately abandoned due to its inherent dangers and engineering challenges.
186	15019	6	3	"Based on excerpt, ""The Mooring @CAPS1,"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced certain obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, such as the violent air currents, and the safety of pedestrians. One obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced was the violent air currents. According to the excerpt, the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting. So if a dirigible happened to get caught in this they would be dangling high above pedestrians. Example of this would be, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring @CAPS1 the back of the ship with swivel around and around the mooring mast."" (@NUM1) This made the prospect of safely docking a dirigible incredibly dangerous and impractical. Another obstacle was the safety of pedestrians. When owners heard about the German dirigible, Hindenburg, was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, they decided that it would be even worse if it had taken place in a heavily populated place like New York. An example of this would be, ""owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" The potential for disaster was simply too great. In conclusion, the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"", written by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced certain obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Such as the violent air currents and the city pedestrians, ultimately rendering the ambitious mooring project unfeasible."
187	15020	6	3	The Empire State building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. This building being so tall, large wind shifts were a constant worry. Wind shifts are when the direction of the wind shifts suddenly. One minute its from the East, the next its from the West. On May 6, 1937, when the German dirigible Hindenburg caught on fire, people thought, what would have happened if that was over the Empire State building. Over New York, with such a large population, it would have been hectic. Airships weren't allowed to fly that low anyways, and the disaster highlighted the dangers of such a plan, ultimately contributing to its abandonment.
188	15021	6	3	"The task of trying to allow dirigibles to dock 1,250 ft. above ground over the city of New York not shockingly posed a few obstacles for the builders of the Empire State Building. Before the dirigibles could even try to dock on the mast, the builders had to modify the whole building due to the stress and pressure on the building from the dirigibles. The modifications cost over sixty thousand dollars to strengthen the building. Once the builders finally had all the modifications and building done, they were faced with a whole new set of obstacles. Most of the dirigibles from out of the United States were filled with flammable hydrogen. ""The German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey."" This accident worried everyone. Also, they faced problems with the shifting winds and air currents that made it difficult to dock the dirigibles. Another obstacle was the fact that laws existed against airships flying too low to the ground. Due to these unforeseen obstacles, the idea of docking on top of the building disappeared, rendering the expensive modifications ultimately pointless."
189	15022	6	3	Based on the information given in the excerpt, there are multiple obstacles they couldn't have been overcome by the builders of the Empire State building. Between the winds, problems with anchoring, risk of Fire and sharp spires, there were also legal issues that would first have to be bested. One thing the builders of the Empire State building hadn't considered was the wind current. Because the dirigibles were primarily huge propelled balloons, the wind could push them around, and at 1,250 feet, there isn't very much around to slow or block the wind. They also didn't think about the fact that hydrogen, a key gas involved with lifting dirigibles, was very flammable and if one was to ascend in flames, dozens or maybe even hundreds of people below would be doomed. More problems the architects faced were the sharp spires atop many of the buildings around. If a pilot were to lose control of the blimp, then it would cause millions of dollars of damage to the city. Lastly, a new law was undergoing a legislation process. It prohibited the flying of any air travel below a certain feet in residential areas. Ultimately, these unforeseen complications, ranging from safety concerns to legal hurdles, proved too significant to overcome, rendering the dirigible docking plan impractical.
190	15023	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock atop it. One major obstacle was safety, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"". The owners quickly realized how dangerous an accident would be ""above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"". The second major obstacle was nature; ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". A thousand-foot dirigible moored atop the building would add enormous stress to the frame of the building. In the end these two obstacles would be too great. Times were changing and with the air plane taking over modern travel the dirigible and the mooring mast were doomed."
191	15024	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when it came to allowing dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast of the building. They first had to modify the top of the building to serve as a mooring mast, and the steel frame had to be reinforced to accommodate the weight and stress of a dirigible. Creating a docking and ticketing area also presented a logistical and financial challenge. The potential for disaster was also a major concern, with the risk of the dirigible hitting the building or even catching fire due to its flammable hydrogen gas. Nature itself posed a significant challenge, as the winds around the skyscraper were often turbulent and violent. Furthermore, a law restricting dirigibles from flying too low over urban areas added another layer of complexity. Finally, the possibility of the dirigible's outer shell breaking and causing harm to people on the ground was a serious safety hazard that needed to be considered, so docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building was ultimately deemed impractical.
192	15025	6	3	When building a structure as big as the Empire State Building and even having it dock a Dirigible to the top of it means there will be challenges to face. In order for it to dock, the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. The building would have to be **exceptionally sturdy and rigid** to withstand these forces. All these problems must be taken into consideration. This would mean spending more money. Therefore, the overall design and construction would be significantly more complex and costly to ensure safety and stability.
193	15026	6	3	When the builders of the Empire State Building were attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, they had great intentions but faced some obstacles along the way. This job was not an easy thing to accomplish, it's not as simple as it might sound. If the builders added a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, it would add stress to the buildings frame. All of the stress would be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, so they would have to modify and strengthen the steel. This would cost over @MONEY1, and thats a lot. The greatest obstacle was nature itself, the wind up at the top was constantly shifting. This wouldn't be safe either. There was also a law against airships driving too low and this would enable them from being able to dock. Also since other dirigibles from other countries used hydrogen instead of helium, it could easily cause a fire. The main obsticle for the builders was saftey when they were building this, there were many unsafe outcomes so it was too risky to construct. This combination of factors ultimately made the dirigible docking plan impractical and far too dangerous to implement.
194	15027	6	3	One of the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced was that the construction of the mooring mast would add stress to the building due to its height. The architects, however, were able to design a special type of stainless steel that would be illuminated from the inside and provide support. Another obstacle was that the dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, and having such an airship with flammable gas nearby civilization was considered unreasonable. Thus, a law was passed that forbade the transportation of dirigibles close to the public. Nature was also against the architects, and so posed a safety hazard when high-speed winds attempted to **snatch** the dirigibles from the sky while being weighed down with lead weights. In the end, the mooring mast on the Empire State Building was never used due to these issues.
195	15028	6	3	There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock, there. They had known that the mooring mast wasn't perfect. There were many reasons but the greatest one they said was the safety. The hydrogen used to keep them afloat is highly flammable, and after the Hindenburg accident in New Jersey in 1937, they noticed how much more dangerous it would be if such a disaster happened right in New York City. So they dropped the idea later on and left the transportation to the airplanes, concluding that the risks outweighed the potential benefits.
196	15029	6	3	"There were several obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major problem was the stress added to the building's frame when the dirigible wore it at the top of the building. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" This meant that they would have to rearrange the frame to make it work, requiring significant redesign and reinforcement. Consequently, the workers were never able to accomplish the goal. Safety was a major factor in the failure to dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building; dirigibles were highly flammable, which could have caused a serious accident to occur. However, the ""greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Because there were heavy air currents above the building, it would cause the dirigible to ""swivel around"" when attached to the mooring mast. There was also an existing law that prohibited planes to fly low over city areas, which made it impossible for dirigibles to reach the building safely and legally. As a result of all these obstacles, the main goal to dock dirigibles was not achieved, proving the impracticality of the ambitious plan."
197	15030	6	3	"Obstacles that the builders had faced involved safety for those below the dirigible and those on it. One problem they faced was the potential for disaster; if something happened to the dirigible like the Hindenburg, then the pedestrians below could get hurt if the zeppelin came crashing down. It was also a problem with passengers because in a city they could easily crash. It tells how when the ""Los Angeles"" tried to get close enough it couldn't because the strong winds so high up could have knocked it into a different building. Other obstacles builders faced were nature and the law. When high up, wind currents can be very strong and changing. It talked of how if the dirigible were tethered the wind would cause the back of the ship to keep swiveling around the mooring mast, making docking difficult. The final obstacle builders would have to overcome was the law. There were already laws in place preventing dirigibles from flying low in urban areas. If ships had tethered to the building than they would have been doing so illegally. These safety, environmental, and legal concerns presented significant hurdles for anyone attempting to integrate dirigibles into the urban landscape."
198	15031	6	3	"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there The higher calling for which the mooring mast was built was to put New York on the forefront of modern travel; the builders then, needed to solve some obstacles that were on their way. First was that the building itself needed to get stronger in order to support ""a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building"" As a result, the frame of the Empire State Building needed to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the problem. According to the excerpt, $2 million worth of changes had to be made to the building's framework. Another problem was that of the stress of the wind pressure The wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. This was also solved, at least they thought, by making a few changes to the skeleton of the building. Lastly, was that the building needed a space to provide for passengers that were to come from the ""blimps"". To solve the problem, they built a shaft to bring passengers down to the 86th floor, where baggage and ticket areas would be located. The builders had to face many problems even before attempting to build a mast for dirigibles to dock at, showcasing the ambition and the challenges inherent in such a groundbreaking endeavor."
199	15032	6	3	"Various obstacles came up in this excerpt. This building of the mooring mast simply went from a dream to more of a way to win a record for the world's tallest building. The greatest obstacle they faced was the issue of safety. In paragraph @NUM1 it reads ""Most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Therefore, an obstacle faced was the danger of the dirigible being destroyed by fire while trying to dock on the Empire State Building which would cause a large amount of destruction in New York. The builders, also faced the problem of nature itself. The violent air currents at these heights would cause the dirigible to swerve around the mooring mast. The builders also faced a legal issue stating in paragraph @NUM2 ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". Thus, the dirigibles were never going to be allowed to fly so close to the Empire State Building anyway. These were the obstacles faced by the builders, ultimately rendering the mooring mast project impractical and highlighting the significant challenges that had to be overcome."
200	15033	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph nine it states ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" This obstacle was massive because in order to accommodate the new station over sixty thousand dollars worth of work would have to be made to the building. Another reason as stated in the text was that the mooring mast itself would have taken up valuable office space. The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This shows this was another major obstacle for the builders. Another obstacle for the builders is nature as stated in the text, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This could be very dangerous. If the back of the ship was dangling over the streets surrounding the Empire State Building there could be many safety hazards. These obstacles were the main obstacles the builders had to face if the Empire State Building would be a landing dock, and ultimately they proved insurmountable, rendering the docking plan unfeasible."
201	15034	6	3	"Based on the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, such as safety, nature, and legislation. First, it would be difficult to safely allow foreign dirigibles to dock. In paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This displays the fire, and therefore safety, was an obstacle. Next, air currents made it difficult for dirigibles to dock safely. The air near the top of the building was affected by air currents, so it was difficult for pilots to land. Also, ""using [lead weights] at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical or safe."" There was no way to work with or combat the uncertainty of the wind, so nature was an obstacle. Finally, there were laws about aircrafts flying too close to the city. In paragraph @NUM2 it says, ""[There] was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" The very purpose of the moor would be illegal, so it would be nearly impossible for a dirigible to ever tie up to the Empire State Building. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges regarding the moor, and its opening was never successful as a result of them."
202	15035	6	3	"In the short excerpt, The Mooring Mast By Marcia Amidon L¸sted there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. An obstacle they faced was the space. An example ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" saying it was going to be hard finding a place to land. Although that may had been one of their problems that was not the only problem it was the safety. The excerpt says, ""the mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service and to let passengers off and on."" Which meant it would have taken a long time just to land and fueling, posing a safety risk. Another obstacle was for the dirigibles to be tested in the testing of the mast. They had to consider wind speeds and how to securely attach the airships. Thus, space, safety concerns during landing and refueling, and the challenges of testing the mast were all significant hurdles."
203	15036	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The biggest obstacle was finding a safe way to do it. New York City is a very densely populated area so any type of accident would be horrific, as the owners realized in @CAPS2 @NUM1, ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the empire state building realized how much worse that accident couldve been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as @CAPS1."" Another obstacle was nature itself. The wind at the top of the building was too strong as it says in @CAPS2 @NUM2, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currants. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast."" Safety was clearly the biggest concern. Therefore, the combination of potential disaster in a crowded city and unpredictable weather conditions ultimately made the dirigible docking plan unfeasible."
204	15037	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced included a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for ships to ever tie up to the building, fearing that the wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in that area, which would harm the dirigible's shell. Then another dirigible attempted a publicity stunt, when it would tie up and deliver a bundle of newspapers to the Empire State Building. The idea of the mooring was shelved because the yet unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height made it undesirable. The highest open observatory dock, intended for disembarking passengers, has never been open to the public, ultimately rendering the airship mooring concept impractical and unsafe.
205	15038	6	3	"The builder's main problem with safety was paramount. Most Blimps that aren't made in @LOCATION1 are filled with hydrogen, which is highly flammable. If a disaster like the Hindenburg accident happened while the blimp was moving to the tethers at the Empire State building, the outcome would have been much more disastrous, especially given the building's height and the surrounding urban density. Another obstacle was the winds, posing significant challenges to maneuvering. According to the excerpt ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents... the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" making docking a precarious endeavor. One final obstacle was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas, further complicating the already difficult task. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building,"" effectively rendering the entire project infeasible from a legal standpoint. The builders faced many obstacles by attempting to allow blimps to dock at the Empire State Building, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the ambitious, yet inherently unsafe and impractical, plan."
206	15039	6	3	"There were obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, the excerpt says, ""A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on."" This shows that builders had to build a mooring mast to have some time for refueling or service and have people get off and on safely; this mast needed to be structurally sound enough to withstand the forces exerted by a large airship. Another example from the excerpt is when it says, ""The body of the dirigible could swing in the breeze, and yet passengers could safely get on and off the dirigible by walking down a gangplank to an open observation platform."" This shows that the builders build a gangplank for people can walk up or down the gangplank safe from the dirigible; this gangplank would need to be adaptable to the movement of the airship to ensure passenger safety. These design challenges underscore the complexities involved in realizing the vision of an airship terminal atop the Empire State Building."
207	15040	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building were faced with many different obstacles. One was the Empire State Building itself. It is one of the tallest buildings in the world, so any construction plan that goes wrong could be tragic for all the people below. When they started construction on the mooring mast, they knew there was some risk but didn't think it through. All this was introduced because Al Smith wanted the Empire State to be the biggest. Now, he didn't really look into it; if a blimp were to land on the mooring mast, they would have to worry about weather, wind, and also the strength of the building's foundation. Also, they would have to worry about the blimp itself; back then, dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, and if something were to go wrong over downtown New York and the blimp were to catch a spark, it would burn four city blocks, which highlights the massive potential dangers.
208	15041	6	3	The developers of the Empire State building faced many problems when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some of the problems are that some blimps are filled with hydrogen which is highly flammable. If a blimp with hydrogen in it exploded over New York City that would not turn out so good for people in New York City. Those people could die. Also, one blimp exploded in New Jersey; the blimp had hydrogen in it. So when that happened, they thought a lot about the docking station and decided only to allow blimps with helium in them to dock there, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the initial dirigible docking plan due to safety concerns and logistical impracticalities.
209	15042	6	3	The idea of allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building was laden with problems ranging from natural preventions to pre-existing laws. During the time of frequent dirigible travel in the world, a German dirigible called the Hindenburg was destroyed in New Jersey due to a complication with fire. This catastrophe revealed to the workers a problem they had previously overlooked, the fact that most foreign dirigibles were inflated with flamable hydrogen gas. The idea of a problem like the Hindenburg ocuring over one of the most densely populated cities in the world ruled out the idea. The workers of this project also overlooked the laws against airships flying too low over urban areas. Although the empire state building was anticipated to be the tallest building in the world, the soon to be created mast would still be too close to the millions of people in the city. After test runs had occured to try out the new mooring system it was seen that dirigibles were not even able to get close enough to the mast due to the strong winds. The idea that these same winds would blow the dirigible into another buildings spire put fear into the minds of the people. The combination of this variety of problems ultimately made the impracticality of the mooring mast abundantly clear, and thus put an end to the idea of using it atop the Empire State Building.
210	15043	6	3	"Al Smith and the builders of the Empire State building faced several obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle was designing strengthening beams to the frame and foundation to support the extra stress caused by the dirigible's load and wind pressure. The second was that the gases used in some dirigibles were unsafe, as ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (L¸sted, @NUM1). The inefficient the gases, the violent air currents would either cause the dirigible to spend, or add lead weights which would ""... be dangling high above pedestrians"" (L¸sted, @NUM2). Among all of these problems ""... was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (L¸sted, @NUM3). Consequently, considering the structural challenges, safety concerns with flammable gases and potential falling weights, and the legal restrictions in place, the endeavor to dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building proved to be an ultimately impractical proposition."
211	15044	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem that the workers faced was that a ""thousand-foot dirigible... would add Stress to the building's frame"" (@NUM1). This meant that the frame would have to be Strengthened to bear the massive weight. Another obstacle they came across was that there was a ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (@NUM2). Therefore, it would be illegal to dock a ship on the building, because the airship would violate the altitude restrictions. Finally, the most difficult obstacle they encountered was that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly Shifting due to violent air currents"" (@NUM3). This made it unsafe and unpractical because the dirigibles would be difficult to control, especially with pedestrians below. Due to all of the complications and challenges that faced the workers who were trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the project was never completed."
212	15045	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon, the builders of the Empire State Building faced some obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of these obstacles was that it was unsafe. It was unsafe because the dirigibles use more hydrogen than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, posing a significant risk. In the excerpt it says the greatest obstacle was nature itself. This is because the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting, and the back of the airship would swivel around, making docking incredibly difficult and dangerous. Another obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, further complicating the mooring mast concept. These are the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced, ultimately rendering the dirigible docking plan impractical."
213	15046	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building were faced with many problems when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. One main reason was that it was illegal for dirigibles to dock. ""Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"", @CAPS1 @NUM1. Also mother nature prevented dirigibles ability to dock there. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"", @CAPS1 @NUM2. However some dirigibles attempted to dock. In 1930 the U.S. Navy, Los Angeles tried to dock, but due to the severe winds could not. New York was a very densely populated area, and having explosive hydrogen floating low over the city could cause a huge threat. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey."" This showed the builders and owners of the Empire State Building that it was very dangerous for dirigibles trying to dock there, highlighting the potential for catastrophic accidents. A main set of problems the builders faced was making the building itself strong enough to allow dirigibles to dock, which required significant engineering modifications. The builders had to modify the frame of the Empire State Building and design a custom mooring device. The builders were faced with legal and safety problems when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, ultimately rendering the dirigible docking plan unfeasible."
214	15047	6	3	"The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted explains the plans for adding a mast to the top of the Empire State Building that would have been able to anchor blimps to the top of it. This idea was very complex; however, architects of the 1930's believed that it was quite possible. What they didn't seem to realize was just how many problems and obstacles there were to get in the way of the mast's success. One minor set back was that the mast (and the blimp attached to it) would add great amounts of stress to the frame of the building. This problem was taken care of with little stress by simply modifying in strengthening the building's foundation and frame. The largest obstacle standing in the way of the mast's success was the heavy winds at the top of the building, which were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". However, the absolute greatest issue that was faced was safety of the public, as designers had to consider how passengers would safely disembark. Most foreign blimps at the time were filled with highly flammable gas, which was ultimately why the mooring mast was never a success."
215	15048	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Throughout the excerpt the author states that ""dirigibles were being hailed as the transport of the future"" (paragraph @NUM1). This meant that builders had to work harder and figure out ways to get this to work, despite the challenges. Architects and engineers talked with experts about the equipment needed to handle the dirigibles. The author also states that they asked people to test the dirigible mooring system. They had to work on the mooring mast in order to get the dirigible to work properly. Getting the mooring mast to work was very difficult for the builders. In paragraph @NUM2 it says ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" High winds, in particular, made the process far too dangerous and impractical. Ultimately, dirigibles were basically given up on by the 1930s, rendering the Empire State Building's docking station obsolete before it ever truly functioned as intended."
216	15049	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were highly challenging. They dealt with the frames and shapes, but there were other reasons that were not so physical. One of the greatest obstacles they faced to allow dirigibles to dock on the building was nature itself. At the top of the building, winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Using the Empire State Building, where the blimps would be dangling high above pedestrians on the lower level of the street, was not safe, as a sudden gust could easily cause a disaster. Another particular obstacle they faced was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal to ever tie up the blimp to the Empire State Building itself, as the low altitude required for docking would violate the regulation. The blimps couldn't land on the flat roof of the Empire State Building, as the space was insufficient and structurally unsuitable for such a heavy landing. The builders of the Empire State Building had a lot of obstacles in front of them, not just physical objects to make it easier for the dirigibles to land, but the constraints of politics and nature as well.
217	15050	6	3	In this excerpt from the mooring mast by Marcia Amidon, there were a lot of examples of obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle that the builders faced was the weight and pressure of a dirigible on one tether at the top of the Empire State Building. This was a big problem because all the stress and pressure of the rope would pull on the building, sending the pressure all the way to the bottom of the building one thousand feet below. Another obstacle that the workers faced was nature itself. This was a problem because of the high-speed winds at the building shifting all the time. If a dirigible was to be tethered at the top by only one rope in the front, the back of it would be free to move in the wind. This would allow the back to be able to be blown by the wind, having the possibility of hitting the building. In conclusion, there were many obstacles builders had to face to attempt this project.
218	15051	6	3	"In the excerpt ""THE MOORING MAST"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted there were many obstacles that the workers had to face to allow Dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State building. One of the many obstacles the workers faced was that they could not simply drop a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State building, as its weight and size required careful planning and construction to integrate it into the existing structure. Also the thousand-foot dirigibles moored at the top of the Empire State building. A single cable tether held the dirigible and it would add stress to the building's frame, which could potentially compromise its structural integrity, making engineers wary of the long-term effects. The biggest obstacle the workers would face was the mooring mast on top of the building with all winds shifting due to violent air currents, which would make docking maneuvers extremely difficult and dangerous. Another obstacle was the dirigibles were moored in open field and they were weighted down in the back. The problem was they were dangling high above pedestrians on the street, creating a significant safety hazard if the mooring failed. These were considerable challenges that ultimately contributed to the abandonment of the mooring mast concept."
219	15052	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mask"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State building faced were nature, safety and the law. Al Smith, @CAPS1 of New York and headed construction of the Empire State Building, was determined to make it the tallest building ever. This would be impossible without a mooring mast, which would serve as a docking station for Dirigibles. In building the mooring mast, came obstacles. One obstacle was nature. There were violent wind speeds at the top of the building, which would cause the dirigible to sway back and forth. Lead weights were typically used to keep from swaying, but if used here, lead weights would be dangling @NUM1 ft above pedestrians heads. Which leads to safety being another obstacle. Many dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, a gas that is highly flammable, if ignited, the possibly largest accident would occur to New York City. The Final obstacle is the law. There is a law that states ""airships may not fly too low over urban areas."" Which would make the mooring mast's purpose illegal. Ultimately, these challenges proved insurmountable, and the grand vision of dirigible docking never materialized. Today, it is nothing more but decoration."
220	15053	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before construction ever took place. The main reason for this was safety. First, there was a chance that it could catch on fire. For example, most dirigibles are made of hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. They realized how much damage it could do if it caught on fire in a densely populated area, such as downtown New York. Secondly, they had another obstacle to the successful use of the mooring that was nature itself. For example, the wind on top of the building was constantly shifting due to the violent air currents. Lastly, dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building because there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach it. Instead of becoming the transportation of the future, the idea had disappeared. They faced too many obstacles that could not be overcome."
221	15054	6	3	Attempted to commit to building this. They realized after that it wasnt that smart or that safe to have a dirigible hanging by a 102 floor building just by one cable tether. Another problem they ran into was the fact that they couldnt control mother nature; unexpected gusts could strain the tether. If it was a really windy day out it would be hard to keep it steady, causing potential damage. And if there wasnt enough support on the building frames, then it could potentially collapse, leading to disastrous consequences. Ultimately, the project's inherent risks proved insurmountable.
222	15055	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced multiple potential problems in allowing dirigibles to dock there. For example, the strong winds up above the city streets could have caused the dirigible's back end to blow sideways and puncture on the tops of other buildings. On top of that, many dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, making them highly flammable. Also, the added stress of a dirigible moored on the Empire State Building could have easily cracked or collapsed the building and its foundation. Luckily, the builders and engineers behind the mooring mast had enough sense to cease production of the mast, because it was merely an excuse to cover up the competitive nature of the building's designers. Ultimately, abandoning the dirigible mooring mast was a sensible decision, given these many hazards.
223	15056	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles trying to allow dirigibles (blimps) to dock there. Lack of a suitable landing area was a tough obstacle, especially considering the building's limited rooftop space. It is against the law for airships to fly low over urban areas. It would be dangling high above people and it wouldn't be safe. The way the dirigibles stays up in the air is it uses hydrogen instead of helium yet hydrogen is extremely flammable. To have a dock for the dirigibles on the Empire State Building it would not be safe and the builders would have to think of a new plan therefore, there would be many obstacles. With these considerations, the impracticality of the dirigible docking plan became clear, forcing a shift in focus.
224	15057	6	3	During the @DATE1's technology and engineering wasn't quite as advanced. So it's safe to say builders of the Empire State Building had some obstacles. One of them was, how were they going to dock the dirigible safely and keep them stable; they had no idea. They did *not* have the knowledge or technology to do such a thing back then. Consequently, the original plan for a dirigible mooring mast atop the building proved impractical due to strong winds and logistical challenges, ultimately being abandoned, which demonstrates the limitations they faced.
225	15058	6	3	"There were many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One problem that was addressed was the fact that dirigibles all over the world were mostly filled with hydrogen, which was flammable. This was a problem because on May 6, 1937 a dirigible was destroyed by fire and the owners of the Empire State building realized ""how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place of a densely populated area."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) Another potential problem were the strong wind currents on top of the building, as described in @CAPS1 @NUM2. The concern was that these strong currents would prevent a dirigible from docking, and could possibly blow it into another building. This could puncture the dirigible's material and cause a horrifying accident. The final obstacle that prevented dirigibles from docking on the Empire State Building was the fact that it was against the law. The law stated that ""airships flying to low over urban areas"" was prohibited. There were many obstacles that prevented dirigibles from docking on the Empire State Building, ultimately making the ambitious plan impractical and unsafe."
226	15059	6	3	"In this @CAPS1 ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1 the builder of the Empire State building faced many @CAPS2 challenges during the building of the Empire State building. The @CAPS3 biggest obstacle would be the wind. Because The building was so high And the more up the more Air and wind they had to stop landing or Drop off the dirigible. A dirigible is also a balloon or blimp but they’re different because the dirigibles can be controlled by propellers. Another reason was the @CAPS4 inadequate equipment. They didn't have the right equipment to dock the dirigible. So they @CAPS5 refrained from letting them dock there ever again. They also @CAPS6 decided to stop it because it's over hundreds of civilians and if something goes @CAPS4 wrong the balloon could fall on the civilians. Those Are the reasons Why in the @CAPS1-""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1 had to face problems with docking balloons, ultimately making the endeavor impractical and unsafe."
227	15060	6	3	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles dock there. One example is, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. When the builders realized that hydrogen is flammable, they had to rethink the construction for if there was a fire it would be much more dangerous in a populated area like New York. The chances of people getting hurt or injured are more likely. Another obstacle was, ""dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building [because] of an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for shipped ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" This was a major obstacle because the builders would have been violating a law and endangering people. The law's existence underscored concerns about safety and the practical difficulties of maneuvering such large airships in a crowded airspace. It is clear that the combination of flammable fuel and legal restrictions ultimately made the dirigible docking plan infeasible."
228	15061	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in order to attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One issue was that the winds at the top of the building were very dramatically shifting because of the air currents. Because of this, the dirigible end would swivel around the top of the building. Another issue was the people walking the streets of New York below the building. To stop a dirigible, heavy lead weights had to be used. This was problematic because one of the weights could very easily come loose and fall to the ground. The law that was about a flying airship lingering too low over a city would be broken if a dirigible had been stationed at the Empire State Building, thus making the docking idea unfeasible.
229	15062	6	3	"Builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Safety was a prominent issue; if human lives are at risk, an idea is not likely to be successful. Most foreign dirigibles contain hydrogen, an element that is ""highly flammable"" (paragraph @NUM1) and posed a threat to not only the passengers, but the people at the docking station as well. Another potential obstacle was the violent winds at the top of the building. These winds would cause the back of the dirigible to blow around freely with the wind. Even the proposed solution of weighing down the rear of the dirigible with lead weights was dangerous; lead weights would be left ""dangling high above pedestrians"" (paragraph @NUM2). A final and very obvious obstacle for the builders of the Empire State Building was the pre-existing law prohibiting airships that fly ""too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM3). Even with a safe docking station, landing would be illegal. Although it may have seemed like a feasible plan at the time, the idea of dirigibles docking on the top of the Empire State building was not a safe or practical one."
230	15063	6	3	"While the construction of the Empire State Building was in progress, the builders faced many obstacles in trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. At first, people thought it was going to be wonderful and lead to the ""transportation of the future"". One obstacle the builders faced was the fact that a large dirigible moored to the roof would have negative effects on the building's frame. ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"". The builders would have to pay $2 million to fix this problem. Another problem that was present was also the lack of safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Also, even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the violent winds would cause the back of the ship to swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Even if the back of the dirigibles were weighted down with lead, it would not be safe; as the lead would be ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street."" There was also a law stating that airships could not fly too low above urban areas. Nature itself presented many more problems, such as winds blowing the dirigible onto the ""sharp spires of other buildings."" As numerous problems became apparent after the building was finished, the idea of dirigibles being the ""future of transportation"" from the Empire State Building was ultimately dropped."
231	15064	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone"". This quote by Irving Clavan is saying that there are many unsolved problems because of the height, meaning it's harder to do because of how high it is. The excerpt notes this height presented engineering challenges with the mooring process itself. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" They're pointing that out because if there's ever a mishap and a crash occurs, it's coming down on one of the most populated cities in America, creating a potentially catastrophic situation. These were some of the serious obstacles builders had to face during the planning and construction."
232	15065	6	3	In The Mooring Mast builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The obstacles the builders faced were that they realized hydrogen, the lifting gas for these airships, was very flammable. An example from the excerpt is a German dirigible was caught on fire; the builders then thought how much worse it would of been over a densely populated area like New York City. Another obstacle was the use of the mooring mast itself. The winds at the top of the building were harsh, and made landing a dangerous and difficult maneuver for the large airships. It was also a law that airships could not fly low over urban areas, further complicating the docking process. The builders of the Empire State Building then decided not to use the mooring mast for dirigibles, deeming the entire endeavor too risky and impractical.
233	15066	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle they faced was that if a thousand-foot dirigible was moored at the top of the building by a single cable tether, it would add significant stress to the building's frame, potentially compromising its structural integrity. Another obstacle they faced was that most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen, not helium, for lift; hydrogen is highly flammable, posing a severe safety risk in the heart of New York City. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast, however, was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting, creating violent and unpredictable air currents that made controlled docking extremely difficult. Even if the dirigible were somehow tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mast uncontrollably, further complicating the process. These issues ultimately proved insurmountable, preventing the realization of the dirigible docking plan.
234	15067	6	3	There seemed to be many problems erupting during the making of the dirigibles dock. For one the Empire State building's natural structure couldn't handle its weight, therefor architects had to make a stainless steel tower. Even after this was made, they realized how flammable helium and hydrogen are. Not only that, the airwaves at the top of that building are extremely violent. The idea was eventually forgotten about due to the possible accidents that could happen, rendering the ambitious project ultimately impractical and unsafe.
235	15068	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in building a mooring mast for dirigibles to dock on. The first obstacle was the inadequate framework on the building itself because with a mooring mast on top, much stress would be added to the building. It is said that ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework,"" which could also be a cost problem. Secondly, building a mooring mast for dirigibles over densely populated New York City would be extremely unsafe, posing a significant risk to the city below. Dirigibles from foreign countries used hydrogen to keep them afloat, and ""hydrogen is highly flammable."" With the memory of the Hindenburg disaster of 1937 still fresh, any fires above heavily populated New York City would have disastrous effects. Next, the worst obstacle the builders faced was the winds that were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Maneuvering a one thousand foot long dirigible to the top of the Empire State Building would be very unsafe because the winds would blow the back of the dirigible, therefore swivelling the ship around the mast. The final obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock there was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" Even if the building of the mast was a success, the law against dirigibles coming too close would prevent the use of it. All these obstacles the builders faced ultimately proved insurmountable, leading to the ultimate failure of the mast as a practical docking station."
236	15069	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building were faced with multiple obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Although some of these obstacles were fixed early on, others were not brought to the builders' attentions until later on. The first obstacle that the builders encountered were the modifications that were needed to be done to the building's framework. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" (@CAPS1 nine). This strengthening was crucial because the building's original design did not account for the immense forces a moored airship could exert. The Empire State Building would not have been able to support the mooring mast without having the essential modifications done. This process costed an extra sixty thousand dollars. The second obstacle that the builders faced had not even been brought up until after the building had been completed. The wind factor had made it nearly impossible to be able to dock any dirigibles. ""Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This dangerous swirling made passenger transfer unthinkable. With all the pedestrians located on the ground, this factor made it extremely unsafe. The final obstacle that was faced was with the law. Under already existing law, airships were prohibited from flying too low over urban areas. Blimps docking at the mooring mast would be violating this law. Therefore, the legal framework simply wasn't in place to support the envisioned airship docking. The architectures and engineers of the Empire State Building clearly did not look into what was necessary to building the mooring mast, resulting in a costly and ultimately unusable feature."
237	15070	6	3	When architects and engineers planned on building the mooring dock for blimps on the Empire State building they didn't realize all the problems that could happen. One of these problems was a big safety issue. Most blimps used hydrogen instead of helium for lift. Hydrogen is very flammable, unlike helium. If a blimp were to catch fire while on the Empire State, it would end in a disaster for the people on the ground and the building itself. Another obstacle was nature and the weather. The wind at that altitude was unpredictable and the dirigibles would just be swinging wildly in the wind, making it difficult to secure them. If the wind got too strong, it could add a lot of stress to the building's structure and it could collapse. One last reason the plan failed was an actual law. The law stated it was illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas, posing a challenge for approach and departure. Ultimately, the mooring dock on the building would have never worked due to these significant safety, logistical, and legal concerns.
238	15071	6	3	When attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, the builders had many obstacles to face. Most of the dirigibles used at the time were from countries other than the United States, so they used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is very flammable, so if it caught on fire it would go down in a very populated area. Another obstacle was at that height, the wind was very strong and violent. When tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the dirigible would be caught by the wind and swing around the mooring mast. The last obstacle was there was a law stating that dirigibles could not fly too low over urban areas; this made it impossible for a dirigible to ever come close to the building, ultimately rendering the docking station impractical.
239	15072	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a number of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was one of safety; most blimps outside the U.S. used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, posing a significant risk of explosion in the heart of New York City. Another obstacle the builders faced was nature itself. The winds on top of the building are always changing because of dangerous air currents. These winds would cause the rear end of the blimp to move around and around the mooring mast, making docking a difficult and potentially hazardous maneuver. A third obstacle they faced was a law that aircrafts couldn't fly too low over pedestrian filled areas. This law makes it illegal to tie up to the Empire State Building, as dirigibles would inevitably need to descend over crowded streets. Ultimately, these combined challenges proved insurmountable, and the dirigible mooring project was abandoned, rendering the spire a purely aesthetic feature.
240	15073	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles, including nature, safety, and the law, when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders' first immediate concern was for the structure of the building. When moored, the dirigible ""would add stress to the building."" To counteract this added weight, the building would need to be modified and strengthened with additional steel. The builders were also worried about safety after a German dirigible was destroyed in a fire with many lives lost. Since the gas used to keep dirigibles aloft is highly flammable and downtown New York is so densely populated, they realized this could be very dangerous, creating a potential disaster. The greatest obstacle was the high winds on top of the building that, ""were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" With the dirigible tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would be swiveling in the wind, making docking extremely difficult. While lead weights could be used in open landing fields to stabilize the airship, these would be neither safe nor practical when hanging above pedestrians on the streets of Manhattan. Lastly, there was a law existing stating that airships could not fly too low over urban areas, further complicating matters. This would make it impossible for a dirigible to even approach the building without breaking the law. The combination of these obstacles ultimately made it impossible for dirigibles to ever dock at the Empire State Building, and the plan was abandoned."
241	15074	6	3	"In the excerpt there were a few obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The largest issue with allowing the dirigibles to use the building as a mooring site was safety. It mentions in paragraph @NUM1 that the German dirigible, the Hindenburg, was destroyed by a fire in New Jersey. This brought on thoughts about it happening at the Empire State Building. If a dirigible caught fire while attached to the building there would be a high death rate due to New York City being so populated, exacerbating the potential for disaster. Another obstacle would have been keeping the dirigibles from swiveling around the mooring mast. In paragraph @NUM2 the point that having lead weights away down the back of the ship would be quite dangerous with so many pedestrians on the street below. Yet another reason why trying to moor the dirigibles to the building was not practical was because of ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM3). This made it illegal for the ships to tie up to the building, let alone get close enough to try to, further complicating the docking attempts. Tying all of these reasons together is the fact that the wind was too strong at the top of the building for anything to happen safely and without some sort of injury, ultimately making the endeavor far too risky."
242	15075	6	3	The obstacles the builders had to face were rational, but there are some things you should think of first, such as peoples' safety, aircraft height limits, and wind resistance. They then thought about how to dock it and how to get the passengers safely to the landing area. What they did work on was smart though; they had the thing that connects the dirigibles to the dock, the electric winch. They also had a baggage and ticket area. What they thought of was smart, but it seems they prioritized these details before other more critical safety and logistical concerns.
243	15076	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges when attempting to put a dock for dirigibles on top. In order to make New York City the most modern city for travel, Al Smith attempted to put a dirigible dock on top of the Empire State Building. They did finish constructing the mooring mast, although the steel frame of the building had to be strengthened. The stress of the people boarding the dirigible could cause damage to the original framework. Once it was finished, there were @NUM1 attempts the board passengers onto the blimps. Although, they both ended in failure. The builders were not able to overcome the obstacles of the severe winds and laws. Winds could blow the blimp strayed into another building. Also, if a dirigible made of hydrogen was used, it could cause a fatal accident due to the high flammability of it. Finally, there was an existing law that airships from flying close to urban areas. The architects of the mooring mast were not able to overcome these challenges, and the ambitious plan was ultimately abandoned, highlighting the practical limitations of realizing such a vision in a bustling urban environment.
244	15077	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The biggest obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith saw an opportunity for his Empire State Building. One set of engineers and the government people in Washington were figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast. The greatest obstacle itself was Mother Nature, as the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. These unpredictable conditions ultimately proved too dangerous, making the docking concept impractical and representing some of the many obstacles the Empire State Building faced while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.
245	15078	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles related to its original purpose: a mooring mast for airships. They were worried about the hydrogen and the helium being highly flammable, considering the disaster of The Lakehurst Fire in New Jersey, which involved the hydrogen-filled Hindenburg. They were also worried about the back weight of the ship during docking, which could strain the structure. And they feared wind would be blowing it into the spires of the building, which would puncture the blimp's fragile shell, posing a significant risk to both the building and the airship. These challenges ultimately contributed to the abandonment of the airship mooring concept.
246	15079	6	3	Many obstacles approached the builders of the Empire State Building as they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders put reality before theory in order to pick the safest route in docking a dirigible. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used Hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly Flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in New Jersey, the builders realized how dangerous it could be putting that risk in such a densely populated area such as New York, especially considering the potential for catastrophic fires. The greatest obstacle in being able to dock safely was nature itself. The winds on top of the Empire State Building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This would sway the ship around the mooring mast, becoming dangerous for passengers and crew alike. The mooring mast project came to a halt in the late 1930s, in order to keep the people of downtown New York City safe from what was deemed an unacceptable risk.
247	15080	6	3	There are many reasons why the builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph @NUM1 the excerpt states that most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The hydrogen can cause a fire and destroy the Empire State Building and can destroy downtown New York, posing a significant safety risk. Another reason why the builders faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there is because it was against the law. In paragraph @NUM2 the excerpt states there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This could be dangerous to the citizens of downtown New York, as a potential crash could cause widespread damage and casualties. Ultimately, these safety and legal concerns proved too significant to overcome, preventing the realization of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
248	15081	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in the idea of docking a dirigible to a building of such height. Dirigibles, mostly outside of the U.S., were made with hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is an extremely flammable gas, which was very dangerous above a highly populated area such as downtown New York City. Safety was a major concern; an accident like the Hindenburg disaster was something they did not want to risk. The ability of docking a lightweight flyer was also very difficult. With strong winds, after the tether cable was attached, the back end of the aircraft would be blown around, making the aviator of the blimp hard to control. Also, laws restricting aircraft from flying too low near buildings, especially after the Hindenburg incident in New Jersey, further complicated matters. A blimp could possibly hit the spire of another building. The reality of docking these lightweight aircraft was a major safety and difficult logistical concern. These obstacles are what builders of the Empire State Building faced, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan.
249	15082	6	3	"The original plan for the Empire State Building was to be tallest building in the world, at @NUM1 feet. Everything was going well until the competition. The Chrysler Building, threatened to steal the title. When Al Smith announced that he was going to put a mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building, this obviously changed the architects designs. ""The architects designed a shiny glass & chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from the inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building. The rocket-shaped mast would have four wings at its corners... and would rise to a conical roof that would house the mooring arm."" (L¸sted). Two months after the workers started with the new plan, they celebrated because they finished framing the entire building. ""The Empire State building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed. The greatest reason was safety."" (L¸sted) Ultimately, this change in design, while intended to secure the building's place in history, highlighted the impracticality and inherent dangers of the airship mooring concept."
250	15083	6	3	"There were many obsticles the builders of Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles dock there. One obsticle was the buildings frame was not prepared for it. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" The frame of the building could not handle a docked dirigible. To fix this problem, over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications would have had to be made to reinforce the structure. Another obsticle faced by the builders was that most countries other than the United States use hydrogen instead of helium to make there dirigible fly. Hydrogen was very flammable, and builders figured that if an accident like the Hindenburg occurred over a desely populated area like New York, it would be devastating, causing immense loss of life and property damage. The greatest obsticle faced by the builders were the wind on top of the building that was constantly shifting. The shifting winds were caused by very violent air currats, making docking extremely hazardous. While the digarble were tethered to the mast, the back of it would just keep spinning around in circles, further complicating the process. They could not use lead weights to help hold the zeppelin steady because you can't just dangle heavy lead weights over New York City, posing a significant risk to pedestrians below. From the beginning, the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was ridiculous, given the structural limitations, safety concerns, and unpredictable weather conditions."
251	15084	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced some obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle they faced was having to modify and strengthen the steel frame of the building. They had to do this because the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. Another obstacle they had to face was that they had to add two more floors to the building to make a grand total of 102 floors. The 101st floor was a glassed-in observation area and an open observation platform on the 102nd floor, intended to serve as a docking mast. These adjustments highlight the significant engineering challenges involved in accommodating such ambitious aeronautical plans.
252	15085	6	3	"The builders that were attempting to build a dock on the Empire State Building, had to face many obstacles. First, the dirigibles were similar to huge balloons, and they were composed with hydrogen and helium. In the excerpt it says, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (pg 32.) Thus, if a dirigible caught on fire while it was stationed near the Empire State building, it may also catch the Empire State Building on fire, resulting in a hazardous environment for the employees and passengers. Next, attempting to tie down a dirigible to a building, is known to be illegal. In the excerpt it states, ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" If anyone disobeyed this law it may result in punishment; as a result, it would create a new obstacle the builders would have to deal with. Last but not least, the idea of docking airships to a building is extremely unsafe. ""The Airship Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted gives an excellent third reason why airships are unsafe, ""Fearing that the wind would blow the dirigibles onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell."" If a disaster ever took place, many lives would have been lost or severely injured. Finally, the builders and architect would have an extremely hard time convincing high government officials to allow air ships to dock on the empire state building, because the potential risks certainly overpower the benefits."
253	15086	6	3	There is a lot of obstacles in trying to come with an idea of a building. They had to make sure the structure of the building was capable of the high winds it was going to get, requiring advanced engineering calculations and perhaps wind tunnel testing. Plus, they also had to make sure the top was safe enough for the dirigibles to dock there without harming any people or the building, mandating specialized mooring systems and fire suppression measures. The building's design needed to integrate both the structural fortitude to withstand severe weather and the operational safety for lighter-than-air aircraft, ensuring a harmonious and secure environment.
254	15087	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mask"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, In order to allow dirigibles to dock there, the builders of the Empire State Building had to face obstacles. First, ""the lack of a suitable landing area"" meant they had to devise a way to accommodate the immense size of the airships on the relatively small rooftop. Second, adding a mooring mast would ""add stress to the building's frame,"" requiring significant structural reinforcement. Lastly, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting,"" posing a considerable challenge to safely docking these massive airships; thus, they needed to mitigate the wind's effects near the tower. Hence, In ""The Mooring Mask"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, in order to allow dirigibles to dock there, the builders of the Empire State Building had to face formidable obstacles."
255	15088	6	3	"In the passage ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the obstacles builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are brought out. The author brings our ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"". The climate and winds were constantly changing at the height of the building, presenting unpredictable conditions. The back of the dirigibles would then swivel, creating a potentially dangerous situation for both the airship and the building. Also the builders had to take into account the fact ""most dirigibles... used hydrogen rather than helium, & hydrogen is highly flammable."" The Empire State Building is in the middle of New York, a highly populated State, further amplifying the risk. The explosion of a dirigible at the top of the Building would be very dangerous and would lose a lot of lives, making the project incredibly risky. The builders of the Empire State Building under went many challenges in trying to allow Dirigibles to dock, ultimately revealing the impracticality of the endeavor."
256	15089	6	3	"As the Empire State Building was being built to allow dirigibles, or blimps, to dock there, the workers faced several problems in trying to accomplish this. The first of these obstacles to occur to the workers was the framework of the building. The building needed to be sturdy enough for the blimp to dock there with the harsh winds constantly pushing the blimp in different directions. Without the proper frame work, it would be extremely dangerous to dock, as the structure might not withstand the forces. The next obstacle for docking was the hydrogen gas powering the dirigibles. Hydrogen is extremely flammable, and there had been other previous accidents with hydrogen blimps, such as the Hindenburg disaster, which made people wary of the entire process. The workers realized that an accident with exploding blimps would be very dangerous in a such ""densely populated area."" The final obstacle workers faced was the harsh wind currents at that altitude. The winds were so strong, that the blimps could not even get close enough to dock, rendering the docking station essentially useless. The workers suggested weighting down the blimp would lead weights, but seeing as the weights ""would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street,"" it ""was neither practical nor safe."" Trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building seemed like a good idea initially; however, as time went on the obstacles preventing this became too great and finally shut down the idea, as safety and practicality concerns proved insurmountable."
257	15090	6	3	Based on the excerpt there are a few key obstacles the builders face, one being the safety of the people in the dirigibles and people below them, and two being nature itself. The safety of the people was critical because if something was not safe then it would not be put to use. There were many things that could go wrong such as, the blimp hitting a spire and killing all the people below. The greatest obstacle was nature. If the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast it would get wrapped around the building, or just getting to the mooring would be difficult because of the wind. Overall the mooring mast was not a practical idea. It was just something thought up to compete with the @CAPS1 building, and was not thought through with the aspects of safety in mind, ultimately rendering the entire project questionable from its inception.
258	15091	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One important issue was the Mooring Mast. According to @ORGANIZATION2, ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" (paragraph @NUM1) Another problem would be the dirigible's load. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" (para. @NUM1) One of the main things the architects forgot to take into consideration was the buildings frame. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation.""(para. @NUM1) Therefore, the mooring of dirigibles presented a complex engineering challenge that required significant structural modifications."
259	15092	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was lack of suitable landing area; dirigibles were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City. Another obstacle was the weight of a mooring mast. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened,"" which means they would have to modify the whole frame to bear the weight of the mooring mast, a costly endeavor estimated at over sixty thousand dollars. Safety was also a significant issue. Most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen. Hydrogen is extremely flammable, so if it caught fire over a highly populated area such as downtown New York then the accident would be much worse, potentially causing widespread devastation. Another issue was the fact that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Because of the wind, the dirigible would swivel around the mooring mast, making docking and passenger transfer a precarious, if not impossible, undertaking. These combined challenges ultimately rendered the dirigible docking plan impractical."
260	15093	6	3	Allowing dirigibles was going to be the new way of transportation back in the 1920s. There were many problems with having a mooring dock on top of the Empire State Building. One of the main problems was it was flammable because of the helium and the hydrogen gases that lifted the dirigibles. If there was the smallest spark the entire dirigible would go up in flames in a second; for an example, the Hindenburg German zeppelin that exploded in New Jersey on May 6, 1937, showed how dangerous this could be. The thought of that happening in a more densely populated area like downtown New York made the idea much more dangerous. Another problem with the dirigibles was wind. If there were strong air currents the dirigible would swivel around the mooring mast when it was docked. Also, it was weighed down by lead weights. If it was over pedestrians, it was not safe, creating an unacceptable risk for those below. Ultimately, the dangers associated with flammability and strong winds made the concept of dirigible docking atop the Empire State Building impractical and unsafe.
261	15094	6	3	Based on the excerpt from the Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in building the mooring mast. For example, there was actually a law that prohibited exactly what the builders wanted. The law said that airships could not fly too low over city areas. The mooring mast on the Empire State Building would directly violate that law when the ships come in to dock. Another problem the builders faced was the danger surrounding the airships that would be docking there. The airships, called dirigibles, were like giant balloons and could pop if they touched something sharp enough. The Empire State Building was surrounded by other extremely tall buildings and most of them had long spires on top. Therefore, if the dirigible bumps one of these spires, it could pop and go plummeting to the ground. This presented another problem, as the builders recognized the potential for disaster. Had an airship popped in New York City, it could've killed a large number of people not only in it, but on the ground. During the time of building, the Hindenburg crashed into fields, killing all of it's passengers. The builders thought what the consequences would be if that had happened in the city. This potential catastrophe, coupled with the legal constraints, was the final straw for the builders as they abandoned their lofty goal, because of too many problems that made the mooring mast an unfeasible and dangerous proposition.
262	15095	6	3	"In the expert the builders of the Empire State Building faced a lot of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The fabric that they use for dirigibles is very lighter, ""Cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium to make them lighter than air."" They also imply that the architects did not try hard enough to solve the problems, suggesting perhaps that the strong winds at that height proved insurmountable, or that the economics simply didn't make sense. The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, suggesting that the challenges of docking such fragile craft in the face of unpredictable weather ultimately rendered the ambitious plan impractical."
263	15096	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced some obstacles in attempting to have a dirigible dock. The dock would break city ordinances regarding air traffic. The dock would also be a danger to the people below due to potential debris or accidents. It would also put a lot of stress on the frame of the building, possibly compromising its structural integrity. Therefore, the dirigible dock presented several serious challenges.
264	15097	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring @CAPS1"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted their were obstactes the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock their. One obstacle was the terrible winds. In the excerpt it states how bad the winds are. One dirigible that was going to try to dock there, the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles, couldn't get close enough because of the very strong winds. The Captain feared the wind would blow the dirigible into a sharp spire on one of the buildings in the area and puncture the dirigible's shell, potentially causing a catastrophic tear. Another reason was their was already a law that stated against airships flying to low over urban areas. This made it illegal for any dirigible to tie up to the building or even approach it, further hindering any docking attempts. The last and final obstacle they faced was the fear of crashing. Since most blimps from out of the country used hydrogen rather than helium it was dangerous because hydrogen is very flammable. They heard about the blimp fire in New Jersey and they realize how much worse an accident like that would be on such a densely populated area like downtown New York City, causing a massive loss of life and widespread destruction. And that is the obsacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there: the huge wind gusts, the Law, and the potential disaster of a dirigible crash in the heart of New York City ultimately doomed the ambitious plan."
265	15098	6	3	When constructing a building, workers will face tough obstacles, especially when it comes to building the Empire State Building. In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, Al Smith and other architectural builders faced many problems. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State building because there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Also, as stated in paragraph @NUM2, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making docking dangerous. Both of these obstacles were reasons that explain the failure of the mooring mast. The builders were not successful at their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
266	15099	6	3	"Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles. The first problem was the material of the dirigibles. Dirigibles ""were actually enormous steel frame balloons with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium make them lighter than air."" The first problem is that its material could be broken if it happened to fly into a sharp area of the building, and the ""violent air currents"" did not help, as they would make maneuvering difficult. Since the dirigibles could not be securely weighted down at the Empire State Building's mooring mast, it would be dangerous to have them ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street."" Another obstacle was the fact that the dirigibles were filled with hydrogen. Although dirigibles from the United States were filled with helium (a safer, non-flammable alternative), ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable,"" posing a significant fire risk in the middle of a crowded city. With these obstacles builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, the theory, promising quick transatlantic travel, did not work out in reality."
267	15100	6	3	"Although thousands of dollars and countless hours were spent on the Mooring Mast, certain obstacles prevented dirigibles from docking atop the Empire State Building for safety reasons. First, these dirigibles were not safe to fly over populated areas. Some contained the highly flammable gas hydrogen, posing a significant risk to the city below. Also, a German dirigible called the ""Hindenburg"" burst into flames in New Jersey. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" The winds at the peak of the Empire State Building were violent and unpredictable. It is stated in paragraph four teen, ""The winds on top the building were constantly shifting,"" making controlled docking nearly impossible. These factors ultimately rendered the Mooring Mast impractical, as it would not be safe to dock a dirigible on the Empire State Building."
268	15101	6	3	"In the excerpt of ""The Mooring Mast,"" many obstacles created problems for the builders of the Empire State building and their goal of allowing dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle that came across the builder's minds was that they ""could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof,"" (paragraph 1) because it would damage the building with the amount of pressure pulling on the structure. The second problem that the architects faced was safety. Events from the past such as the Hindenburg disaster, which tragically killed 36 people, was caused by the use of ""hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable...the owners of the Empire State building realized how much worse the accident could've been."" The next problem that came up was nature itself, such as dangerous winds. An event when ""the U.S. Navy dirigible, Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" Furthermore, there were legal issues, and existing law was against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal. These significant challenges ultimately contributed to the abandonment of the mooring mast concept, rendering the ambitious plan impractical."
269	15102	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced the problem of how to keep the back end of the blimp from swaying in the wind. They were unable to solve this problem, as we see in paragraph @NUM1 where it says: ""Even if the derigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Another problem with docking blimps on the Empire State Building was a law that stopped dirigibles from flying too low over populated areas. There is proof of this in paragraph @NUM2 where it says ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" One more problem with mooring dirigibles on the Empire State was that it was hard for pilots to dock their ships on the mooring. An example of this is in paragraph @NUM2 where it says ""The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" These challenges ultimately proved insurmountable, leading to the abandonment of the ambitious plan to use the Empire State Building as a blimp docking station."
270	15103	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Obstacles they faced were the strength of the framework, Safety of the dirigibles, @CAPS1 nature, and a law. The first obstacle, framework, wasn't too hard overcome, it cost @MONEY1 to strengthen it in order to support the mast and a blimp. The second obstacle was safety, on May 6, 1937 the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire due to the highly flammable gas hydrogen which is used in dirigibles. This accedent could have been much worse if it occured above a highly populated area like New York. The third obstacle was @CAPS1 nature, the violent air currents on top of the Empire State Building made it close to impossible to dock a dirigible to the mast. By using led weights to weigh down the back of the blimp would be neither practical nor safe hanging high above pedestrians. The final and forth obstacle builders faced was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal to even attempt docking to the mast. These challenges ultimately proved insurmountable, leading to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan.
271	15104	6	3	While attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast, the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. One problem they encountered was the use of hydrogen in dirigibles rather than the use of helium, which is non-flammable. Hydrogen is highly flammable and actually caused the Hindenburg dirigible to be destroyed by fire in a separate incident, raising safety concerns. Also, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making it difficult for a dirigible to stop swiveling around—a safety hazard for pedestrians below. Lastly, it was illegal for aircraft of any sort to fly so low over urban areas, further complicating the docking process. At first, the idea of the mooring mast was well-liked, garnering public interest and excitement, but in the end it had too many problems and proved to be impractical.
272	15105	6	3	In the 1930s, the world was evolving, and new technologies were coming of age. One of these technologies was the Dirigible, and some people thought to expand its use. One of these ideas was the mooring mast on the Empire State Building. This was a great idea, but the things that stood in its way made it impossible. A major problem was the safety, considering it was 1,250 feet up. Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If this thing caught on fire, everyone inside would burn to death or crash into the ground and kill everyone under it. Another huge problem was the winds and ease of pushing it off course. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. These winds made it simply impossible for this to happen. One problem that should have been looked at from the beginning was law. The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This mooring mast was a fantastic idea, but there were too many things standing in its way, ultimately rendering the concept unworkable and unsafe.
273	15106	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, describes complicated obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles was competition. ""It was planned as the world's tallest building taller even than the new Chrysler Building,"". ""Al Smith realized that he was close to losing the title of world's tallest building"". There was a competition as to had the tallest building between the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building. Another obstacle, was the safety and dirigibles. ""when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as down town New York."". The owner didn't want to risk a accident to cost people's life it would have been bad rep for them. The obstacles that the builders went through was a positive thing, it made them more cautious and open their eyes."
274	15107	6	3	"There are many obstacles faced because of letting the dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building. First, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" This means that the winds ontop of the building were strong and the dirigible would swivel around the mooring mast, if tethered, making the process dangerous and impractical. Also, ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the areas."" This shows that it was a waist of time thinking ships could moor at the State Building because there is a clear law against it, and it would take a lot of effort to change the law. There still are many obstacles you have to over come for any project, and the Empire State Building's dirigible docking plan was ultimately impractical because of both natural and legal barriers."
275	15108	6	3	"Based on the excerpt from The Mooring Mast, there are three main obstacles that prevented the Mooring Mast on the Empire State Building from being used in the way it was intended. The first obstacle was safety. Dirigibles, especially those using hydrogen, are highly flammable machines, and a fire in New York City would be tragic. Another obstacle that the Mooring Mast faced was Nature. The mooring was designed to attach to the dirigibles with an electric winch, allowing the dirigibles to move freely. When the winds of the upper atmosphere were to blow on this situation, the dirigibles would ""swivel around & around the mast"" (Smith, 1931), which would cause tension to build on the building's frame and lead to a very unsafe environment. The last reason was that a law was created that stated that it was illegal for a ship to fly too close to urban areas for safety reasons, rendering the whole Mooring Mast unusable. Thus, a combination of safety concerns, uncontrollable weather conditions, and legal restrictions ultimately led to the Mooring Mast's abandonment as a practical docking station."
276	15109	6	3	Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders faced while attempting to build the dirigible dock at the Empire State Building were: finding a way to make this building bigger than the Chrysler Building, designing the mast, and facing the reality of hydrogen's flammability. Al Smith needed a way to make his building bigger than the Chrysler building, so he came up with the idea of putting a mooring mast on the building. The idea seemed great initially, but while designing the mast, architects realized they couldn't just place the mast right on top of the building; they'd have to modify the foundation to support it. After changing the skeleton of the building to accommodate the mast's weight and stress, construction went on as planned. Two months later the mast was finished, but the architects then realized that most dirigibles use hydrogen, which is highly flammable and posed a significant safety risk. Ultimately, all the work the architects put in was for nothing because the mooring mast was never used due to the inherent dangers associated with hydrogen.
277	15110	6	3	There are always challenges when you are trying something innovative. There are obstacles like getting approval, gaining support and you also need to be structurally sound. Al Smith and the rest of these architects faced all of these issues. During the 1920s dirigibles were supposed to be the future of travel. Al Smith wanted to be able to dock a dirigible on top of the Empire State Building. Other than getting people to go along with the plan, he had other problems that proved to be quite significant. The wind is very violent at that altitude making docking a dangerous proposition. Dirigibles were not supposed to fly that close to the city; the density of buildings made aerial navigation dangerous, and some were highly flammable, increasing the risk. In conclusion, there were too many large obstacles to overcome, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan.
278	15111	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. ""Hydrogen is highly flammable."" The dirigibles ran on hydrogen verses helium and if it were to ever to catch on fire there would be pedestrians everywhere below that would be in grave danger, making the prospect incredibly risky. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Because the dirigible would be docked so high with little back control, the fierce winds would be a huge issue for keeping the massive aircraft stable. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This made maneuvering and securing a dirigible a perilous undertaking. ""...was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This legal restriction presented another significant hurdle for the ambitious plan. The builders a lot more obstacles dealing with the docking of dirigibles than just architectural ones, demonstrating the impracticality of the entire concept."
279	15112	6	3	"The obstacles that builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there included the challenge of constructing a significantly taller building. They also encountered construction difficulties, forcing workers to postpone deadlines. Another obstacle was the mooring mast. ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose."" The workers also did not anticipate these many obstacles; they simply wanted to complete the job, but the complexities of the project ultimately hindered the dirigible docking plan."
280	15113	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced was trying to make sure the building didn't fall down. This required careful planning and the use of innovative engineering techniques to ensure structural integrity, presenting a significant challenge to the construction team. This monumental task was ultimately accomplished through meticulous attention to detail, demonstrating the builders' commitment to creating a safe and enduring skyscraper.
281	15114	6	3	Some problems that the builders faced building the mast on the top of the building was that the builders couldn't just drop the mast on top of the building's flat roof because then the wind would cause stress to the frame, especially considering the blimps could be hanging there, adding to the load. The steel frame of the building would have to be modified and strengthened to support the mast and withstand the additional wind forces. The cost for these modifications were another problem for them, as such structural changes represented a significant increase to the overall budget. Therefore, careful planning and resource allocation were essential to overcome these challenges and successfully erect the mast.
282	15115	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The main obstacle was that the builders couldn't put the mooring mast on the Empire State Building, because it had a flat roof. The mooring mast would put pressure on the building's frame. To overcome this obstacle the architects had to modify and strengthen the frame. More than sixty thousand dollars went into the modifications of the framework, ensuring it could withstand the added stress. The greatest obstacle though was nature, and there was nothing the builders could do about that. The violent air currents caused winds on the top of the building to constantly shift. In open fields dirigibles could be weighted down in the back using lead weights, but with pedestrians around it wouldn't be practical nor safe. Without being weighted down the dirigibles would swivel around, making docking a dangerous proposition and ultimately rendering the dirigible docking plan unfeasible.
283	15116	6	3	"In constructing the Empire State Building, builders faced multiple obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock atop the skyscraper. One obstacle that constructors faced was modifications, ""The stress of the dirigibles load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the foundation."" With this obstacle contractors would need to reinforce the frame of the building and the foundation. And another significant obstacle, as stated from the excerpt, is that ""most dirigibles from outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, which is flammable."" Given that hydrogen is flammable it would not be good if a dirigible exploded over the streets of New York. These were considerable safety concerns in addition to the structural challenges. Those are the obstacles contractors faced during the construction of the Empire State Building's dirigible mooring mast."
284	15117	6	3	"In the excerpt the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. The reason why the builders faced obstacles was because ""architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" An example is ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" This is because the immense weight and pull of a moored airship, especially in windy conditions, would create significant leverage. The stress of the dirigible moor would make the buildings frame bend and become weak. That is just one obstacle that the builders faced, but there is many more."
285	15118	6	3	The builders faced many obstacles by building the Empire State Building. One obstacle was that Al Smith had competition with the Chrysler building, which was forty-six feet taller than the Empire State. This led to Smith making the State Building reach the height of 1,250 feet. This leads to another obstacle: he wanted to add a mooring mast at its top for docking the new airships. This didn't work due to a lack of landing space. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would cause stress to the building's frame. In conclusion, I just explained the obstacles of the Empire State Building.
286	15119	6	3	While building the Empire State Building the architects were faced with many obstacles when the decision was made to use the Empire State Building to dock, load, and refuel dirigibles. How to dock a dirigible to the side of a building, especially one so tall, was one of the biggest concerns, but the amount of stress this docking would cause to the building's structure was an even bigger worry. But the greatest obstacle to this project was the wind, nature itself. The fear was that the wind would blow the dirigible into a neighboring building, and tethering the dirigible was not an option for safety reasons due to the potential for ripping the airship from its moorings. Due to the architect's inability to overcome these obstacles, the ambitious plan proved impractical, and the Empire State Building was never used for its original purpose.
287	15120	6	3	The first obstacle was their expanded use in New York City was the lack of suitable landing areas, because some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four city blocks. The second was that these dirigibles used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. They realized how much worse an accident could have been in densely populated New York. This forced them to rethink their plan. And another problem was the constantly shifting winds on top of buildings caused by violent air currents. These factors ultimately contributed to the impracticality of their initial vision.
288	15121	6	3	"Builders of the Empire State Building faced challenging obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock. ""The greatest obstacle was nature itself."" This was a huge problem for the mooring masts because they could not get close enough to the building to land; the unpredictable and often strong winds at that altitude made maneuvering a large airship extremely difficult and dangerous. Secondly, there was an ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" meaning that because there were so many people in a small area of downtown New York, it was too dangerous for dirigibles and other aircraft to be that low, increasing the risk of accidents. Lastly, dirigibles from outside of the state used hydrogen rather than helium; ""hydrogen is highly flammable."" After the German Hindenburg had an accident involving fire, it was clear that taking the risk of a similar accident happening above the heads of thousands of pedestrians was a bad idea, given the potential for catastrophic consequences. The obstacles, which were noticed too late before the construction was completed, are why dirigibles are not allowed to land on the Empire State Building to this day, rendering the mooring mast project ultimately unsuccessful."
289	15122	6	3	"The obstacles that needed to be overcame, to create the idea of a docking platform on top of what was going to be announced as ""The tallest building,"" was going to be tough. The steps taken to make this idea come to life, began with consulting with experts in aeronautics and structural engineering. They took tours of the equipment and mooring operations at the @ORGANIZATION1 Naval Air Station in New Jersey, observing the intricacies of airship docking firsthand. When it was time to start constructing, the issue of the stress the building would intake from the mass of the Dirigibles became a problem, requiring careful calculations and innovative solutions. They modified the building's frame to accommodate the new situation, reinforcing key structural points. They also designed a stainless steel tower with a stepped back design that imitated the overall shape of the building, blending functionality with aesthetics. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications were made to achieve the goal of ""The Mooring Mast,"" a testament to the ambition and engineering prowess of the era, successfully realizing this ambitious vision."
290	15123	6	3	"There was many obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that a lot of dirigibles outside the United States use hydrogen over helium. The problem was hydrogen is highly flammable, ""when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densley populated area such as downtown New York City."" One can only imagine how tragic and chaotic that would have been. Another obstacle the builders faced was nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting do to violent air currents. That would've meant that these dirigibles could just have got swept back."" The unpredictable winds posed a significant safety risk to the entire docking procedure. In conclusion there was several obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."
291	15124	6	3	"In paragraph @NUM1 it states, ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill it's purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" These reasons are one that is due to flamable gases, a second is due to nature itself, and the last is an already existing law. As said in paragraph @NUM1, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the united States used hydrogen rather than helium."" @CAPS1 how flammable hydrogen is they didn't want that above a highly populated area, especially considering a single spark could cause a catastrophic explosion. Paragraph @NUM3 now states, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting."" @CAPS2 the dirigible would not be stable enough, and the process of docking would be far too dangerous for both the airship and the building. Finally I said in paragraph @NUM4. ""There was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" @CAPS3 there was never a chance of a dirigible being able to dock there, as stated above, making the mooring mast a decorative, albeit impressive, feature."
292	15125	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders had to be cautious about safety, which played a big role with the dirigibles. Many dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen instead of helium for buoyancy. Because hydrogen is highly flammable, they wouldn't want the city to be destroyed and at risk of a massive fire. Another problem was nature itself, as there were violent air currents above the building, and the maneuver would not be safe, nor be a danger to the local pedestrians of New York. The final obstacle builders faced when trying to pursue the dirigible idea was a law that prohibited airships flying too low over urban areas. They would be breaking the law to even allow it within the area of the building. With so many issues occurring in the development of the dirigible plan, the idea of using them quietly disappeared.
293	15126	6	3	Some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced was how to build the mooring mast, and how to attach the mooring mast to the frame of the Empire State Building, a task requiring innovative engineering solutions to ensure stability and safety at such extreme heights.
294	15127	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", builders of the Empire State Building face obstacles in attempting to allow dirigible's to dock there. The main obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing area. Dirigibles need a large area to land. Al Smith said to add a mooring mast to the top of the building and that would allowed a dirigible to land for several hours. During the time of land the dirigible may get ""refueling or service, and to let passengers on and off."" Passengers could get off and on the dirigible safely by walking down a gangplank to the open platform. Architects had trouble putting a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building's flat roof because they were afraid that the load of the dirigible and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted. Dirigibles had trouble with saftly, most of dirigibles use hydroge instead of helium, but hydrogen was highly flammable. The greatest obstacle of mooring mast was nature itself, wind were high due to violent air currents, and it would not be safe for dirigibles. The practical reason why dirigibles weren't allow to moor at the Empire State Building was law agaist airship flying too low. The idea of dirigible was given away to airplanes. The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was solved, as the focus shifted to airplane travel and the dangers of dirigibles became more apparent, leading to the abandonment of the mooring mast concept."
295	15128	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, the workers faced a lot of obstacles in attempting to allow the dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph @NUM1 the architects say that ""they could not simply drop a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State building."" The reason for this is because the top of the roof is held together by just one cable tether. The effect of landing something so heavy on the roof would add stress to the building's frame, potentially compromising its structural integrity. In order to allow the dirigibles there they would need to strengthen and modify the building's framework; this complex undertaking would cost at least over @MONEY1. Rather than doing that, the architects designed a glass, chrome, and stainless steel tower that was @CAPS1 from inside. This innovative structure would ""rise to a conical roof that would house the mooring arm"" offering a safer and more practical solution. Elevators would also be inside to help the passengers board the dirigibles, streamlining the boarding process. Therefore, the architects aimed to create a functional and safe docking system despite the initial structural challenges."
296	15129	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while building it. One obstacle they hit was that dirigibles couldn't dock there because of the absence of a mooring mast. When the architects and engineers built the building, they put a flat roof, making the placement of a mooring mast impossible without significant alterations. They determined that the frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to rectify the situation and support the mast. Another obstacle was that they couldn't use a rope to hold the mooring mast up, as the dirigibles wouldn't be able to bear its weight, rendering the docking process unsafe. These are some obstacles the architects went through while striving to incorporate the innovative dirigible docking concept into the building's design, ultimately influencing the final structure.
297	15130	6	3	"Some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock was that the winds at that height were always changing and difficult to land a dirigible with. Also the dirigibles are highly flammable because they used hydrogen rather than helium. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The project was a bad idea from the start. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" They even attempted to try it before they gave up. ""In December 1930, the @ORGANIZATION2 dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but couldn't get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" It just wasn't made to do that job so it wouldn't work, highlighting the impracticality and ultimate failure of the dirigible docking concept."
298	15131	6	3	The obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building by attempting dirigibles to dock there were too many to predict. The obstacles faced by dirigibles to dock there were because of many variables such as climate, buildings, and most of all the dirigibles themselves. The climate, as said in paragraph @NUM1, consisted of dangerous and uncontrollable winds, and the reason was because of the Empire State Building itself and its height, which created unpredictable updrafts. The urban areas around consisted of sharp hull-breaching spires, and due to the winds, it made a hull breach @NUM2 times more likely due to the difficulty in maneuvering such a large craft in a confined space. Finally, their construction was a problem; dirigibles were made with a steel frame wrapped in cotton and filled with hydrogen to make it lighter; unfortunately, the hydrogen was highly flammable, which made the entire endeavor far too risky. Therefore, the combination of weather, the surrounding environment, and the dirigibles' inherent design flaws ultimately made the docking plan unfeasible.
299	15132	6	3	"In order to let dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building, many changes had to made. The builders and planners both faced many obstacles. First of all, to even consider the idea, they had to ""consult with experts"" which meant taking tours and doing research. They had to find a ""safe way of mooring airships to this mast."" The next obstacle is in paragraph @NUM1. Docking a dirigible to the building would put ""stress"" on the building's frame. The builders had to ""modify and strengthen"" the frame. One of the last obstacles they had to face was designing the tower. The builders eventually decided on a rocket shaped mast with four wings at the corners to house the mooring arm. They had to house the machinery to winch the derigible, too. Overall, the builders had to make drastic changes, spend a lot of money, all for something that wasn't even safe in the end."
300	15133	6	3	"While constructing the top of the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. According to the excerpt, the architects couldn't just drop the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's roof, as the structure wasn't initially designed for such a load. Also, having a thousand-foot dirigible at the top of the building while being held by a single cable would add too much stress on the frame of the building. In order to maintain the dirigible in place, it would cost them money. Quoting the article, ""The stress of the dirigibles' load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation... the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened... sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications."" This significant expense, combined with the engineering challenges, ultimately proved insurmountable. The technical and financial issues made it difficult for architects to build a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building, rendering the original vision impractical."
301	15134	6	3	"The builders faced a few problems on letting it dock there. One problem was that ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" said on page @NUM1. They were all so lead weights to lower the dirigibles down but this could also set a risk for people, said on page @NUM1, making the docking process potentially hazardous and requiring careful consideration of safety protocols."
302	15135	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The architects had to accommodate a lot of things to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast. For example, in the excerpt it says ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" Moreover, the design needed to incorporate a circular walkway for passengers. Also in the excerpt it says ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These factors and many more were the reason the mooring mast was never put to use due to the fear of safety and law."
303	15136	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, there were many obstacles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One reason was the safety. Paragraph @NUM1 from the excerpts explains that, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" It shows us that if an accident was to happen on the mast above a densely populated area like downtown New York, then the accident could get ugly, potentially resulting in a catastrophic explosion. Another reason why was nature itself. Paragraph @NUM2 explains that the, ""winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This was another safety issue because the dirigibles would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, making maneuvering and securing the massive airships incredibly difficult and dangerous. A third obstacle was that there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, further complicating the docking procedures and requiring special permissions or waivers. As you can see those were some obstacles builders faced, highlighting the significant challenges in making the mooring mast a viable option for dirigible travel."
304	15137	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. An obstacle dealt with if the dirigibles were fit to dock in the Empire State Building. Another obstacle dealt with the mast. These obstacles made this construction a failure such as the author who says, ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed"" in Thirteen. First off, Five states the dirigibles were actually enormous steel-framed balloons, with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium to make some lighter in the air."" Six states that, ""Some were as long as one thousand feet."" How may a blimp of that size ever managed to land on the Empire State Building. Also Nine says ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" This also states that ""The stress the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" These were just a few of the obstacles the builders had to face, with the sheer size and structural impact being major concerns. The fate of the mast such as in One says ""was neither practical nor safe."" The architects were blind to the potential problems of the mast. In the end the mast was a great attempt, but indeed a failure."
305	15138	6	3	"The architect of the new building had three large problems with allowing dirigibles to moor at the top. The first problem was the harsh wind that high up made it extremely difficult to dock the dirigible, ""Fearing that the wind would blow the Dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell, the captain could not even take his hands off the levers"". This constant struggle against the elements posed an unacceptable risk. Second The back of the dirigible would not be tied down. This problem would lead to safety hazards with people getting off of it, ""The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This effect would also make a challenging and dangerous to take off, endangering passengers and crew alike. The last reason would be that it is illegal to fly aircraft so low over the city already eliminating the possibility of allowing dirigibles to moor on top. Overall, this idea was not thought out well and was hurried so it would be the first building in the world to have a dirigible mooring mast, and as such, presented too many insurmountable obstacles to be safely or legally implemented."
306	15139	6	3	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders faced many obstacles when attempting to build the Empire State Building for use of dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle that the architects and engineers faced was that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium"" which was very dangerous because hydrogen is highly flammable. This flammability posed a significant risk to the building and the surrounding area. Another obstacle that was faced was that ""the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" even though the dirigible would be tied down to the mooring mast ""the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"" making the docking process incredibly difficult and unstable. Another problem due to the winds would be that ""the wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell"" creating a potentially catastrophic situation. A last example of an obstacle would be that there is a law stating that all ""airships flying too low over urban areas"" was illegal, further complicating the already challenging endeavor. Even if there wasn't a law making it ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" the attemption of even trying would be very dangerous to the people around and below it, and the building itself, ultimately rendering the mooring mast concept impractical and unsafe."
307	15140	6	3	"The obstacles the architects of the Empire State Building faced while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the safety of the people below. Also, as it says in historical documents @CAPS2 @NUM1, ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" posed a significant legal hurdle. Another main reason is in archived reports @CAPS2 @NUM2; the wind currents at that altitude were violently shifting, making docking a dangerous maneuver. Ultimately, these concerns led to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan, prioritizing safety and adherence to regulations."
308	15141	6	3	The obstacles to mooring a dirigible at the Empire State Building were the balloons being made out of flammable material, and the wind blowing the dirigible around, making the entire endeavor exceptionally risky and ultimately impractical.
309	15142	6	3	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, as detailed in the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @PERSON1. The architects and engineers of the Empire State Building were very competitive for the Building to be very tall, and their initial plan lacked thoroughness. They wanted the building to have a great top and wanted it to also be useful, so they considered dirigibles docking there. They figured out after that it wasn't such a good idea when they looked into the history of how many accidents happened. If any accident happened in New York like that, then it would be a very big deal because there are so many people that live there. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mask, making passenger transfer difficult and dangerous. They felt it would be unsafe for many reasons. This is the reason why the builders went through many obstacles, ultimately abandoning the dirigible docking idea due to safety concerns and logistical challenges."
310	15143	6	3	According to the aviation experts both the engineers and the architects came across several obstacles when it came to building an area where blimps could land that made this project unfeasible. One of the primary reasons that this project failed was due to the air laws that made it illegal to fly too low in urban areas. An additional conflict was the fact that strong winds could push the tail of the blimp into the sharp spires of neighboring buildings that would pop the dirigible as if it were a balloon, ultimately proving the impracticality of the endeavor.
311	15144	6	3	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast I have seen how the builders of the Empire State Building ran into obstacles trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. The Empire State Building was already standing when the architects decided to renovate and make a dock for dirigibles. The architects working on this project had to strengthen the building's frame to withstand the immense forces a docking dirigible would exert. They also had to have winches and control machinery for the dirigible mooring. The architects also needed to install housed elevators and stairs to bring passengers down to the base floor and back up. After the renovations were done to the Empire State Building, it had 102 floors. After the building was done, the owners found out that they could not allow dirigibles onto the building because they would break the law regarding airships flying too low in urban areas. So, the Empire State Building was finished, but you could not use it for dirigibles, making the renovation ultimately impractical.
312	15145	6	3	Al Smith announced that the Empire State Building would reach the new height of 1,250 ft on December 11, 1929. His plan was to build a mooring mast at the top of the building to make it equipped for modern travel. The builders faced three main obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle was safety. Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. When the Hindenburg was destroyed in a fire, the owners of the Empire State Building became worried that a much worse accident would occur in New York. The second and greatest obstacle was nature. The winds at the top of the building constantly shifted, which would cause the back of the dirigible to swivel around the mast. The only way to solve this problem was with lead weights. This was not practical or safe. The final obstacle was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This made it illegal for the dirigibles to tie up to the building. In conclusion, the three main obstacles that the builders faced were safety concerns, unpredictable natural elements, and legal restrictions.
313	15146	6	3	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were that there wasn't a lot of room for them to land. The length of them was the same as four blocks in New York City. They also needed to consult with experts and take tours of the equipment. They did lots of experiments and tests on dirigibles. It was also dangerous to have them land there, especially with the strong winds at that altitude. It was also bad for the enviroment because hydrogen is used and it's is highly flammable. Dirigibles can't dock there because it wasn't stable and that makes it not safe for people, ultimately rendering the whole endeavor impractical.
314	15147	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was getting the mooring mast on top of the building. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof. A thousand foot dirigible mounted at the top of the building... would add stress to the building's frame."" The architects solved this problem by integrating the mast's support structure into the building's framework. Another problem was wind. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" With only one wire connected to the front, the dirigible would go round and round due to the back being exposed to the winds. This problem was never fixed, as the unpredictable nature of the high-altitude winds proved too challenging to overcome. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles and while some were overcome, the rest weren't, resulting in the ultimate failure of the mooring mast."
315	15148	6	3	Al Smith had a great idea. When he thought he was going to have a dirigible station dock on top of the world's tallest building. He had great creativity and wanted to use his building to full potential. Although there were many problems to this idea, it was ultimately deemed unfeasible. One was the urban area below; many people lived in downtown New York City, and it would be against the law to have zeppelins flying above the populated area. Another important problem was the intense winds that were harsh and made it very hard to dock on the building, posing significant safety risks. There were many obstacles in the way of fulfilling Al Smith's dream for the Empire State Building to dock dirigibles on the top of the building, which led to the abandonment of the project.
316	15149	6	3	"Some of the things they faced were safety hazards. Like when they said in *NOVA* 102 when the Hindenburg was destroyed they said ""The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could of been if it was over New York."" Another obstacle they faced as they said in *NOVA* 102 was ""Nature itself."" The winds would make an airship sway around like crazy. The last problem was the law stating airships can't fly that low above urban cities, which further restricted their practicality as a mode of transport. These combined challenges ultimately made airships a less viable option compared to other forms of transportation."
317	15150	6	3	"In the @DATE1's dirigibles were considered the transportation of the future. Trying to make New York the forefront of modern travel, the architects and builders of the Empire State building rushed to the challenge of building a mooring mast failling to recognize the obstacles that lay ahead. As the architects designed the mast they quickly realized the frame of the building was not equipped to handle the weight on top of its flat roof. Making those adjustments had cost builders more time and New York City more money. In addition workers had not considered wind currents, further complicating the project. In this excerpt the writer says ""the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" @CAPS1 workers should have considered possible obstacles before building something as big a project as a mooring mast, showing foresight would have prevented wasted time and money."
318	15151	6	3	"Al Smith, four-term governor of New York and a leader of the Empire State Building's construction, had a vision. His vision was to create a two-hundred fifty foot mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building, not only making it the world's tallest building, but also to dock passengers and deliver goods through the use of dirigibles or blimps. Unfortunately, there were many OBSTACLES facing the builders of the Empire State Building regarding the allowance of docking dirigibles on its mast. The main concerns the builders faced were the materials that dirigibles are made out of, mother nature, and airship laws. The first obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced concerning the docking of dirigibles on its mast was the materials dirigibles are made from. According to the article, ""The Mooring Mast"" by PBS, ""Most dirigibles... used hydrogen... highly flammable..."" The builders realized this posed as a huge safety threat, especially over a densely populated city. The second obstacle the builders faced regarding the docking of dirigibles on its mast was mother nature herself. The article states, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents... neither practical nor SAFE). The construction workers realized that having passengers moving on and off the mast, could be very dangerous in harsh weather conditions. The final obstacle the construction workers faced was an overlooked airship law. The story says, ""... an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" (PBS). The workers realized that it was against the law to even tie up an airship to a building. In conclusion, the three main OBSTACLES the builders of the Empire State Building faced in regards to the allowance of docking dirigibles on its mast were the materials that dirigibles are made of, nature, and airship laws, ultimately rendering Smith's ambitious vision impractical."
319	15152	6	3	"In this project to construct a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, there were some problems. The idea of the mooring mast was to be able to dock dirigibles to the top of the Empire State Building + be able to have passengers get on + off the dirigible from + into the building. The big problem that it faced was the wind speeds that high up in the air. At nearly 1,250 feet in the air the wind would be whiping around even a massive, steel, docked dirigible. When New York governor, Al Smith put forth ideas to construct this mast nobody realized untill after that it was a somewhat rediculous task. In paragraph two, it states, ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill it purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" After it was ruled impossible, people started to realize that everyone was just caught up in the new modern travel idea to be down to reality, demonstrating how easily enthusiasm can overshadow practical considerations."
320	15153	6	3	In the excerpt, it talks about making the Empire State Building the tallest in New York. It was the tallest building until architects built the Chrysler Building. The Chrysler Building stood 1,046 feet, 46 feet taller than the Empire State Building. So Al Smith realized he was gonna lose his title for having the tallest building. Then he came up with the idea of adding a top or a hat to the building. The idea Al Smith came up with was adding a landing spot for blimps or dirigibles. Smith knew this would reclaim its status as the tallest. Al Smith knew it wasn't gonna be easy so he thought of possible reasons why it wouldn't work. He had to design another figure that would be able to hold the mass of the blimps. He also had to think about how passengers would get on and off the blimp. He also remembered most blimps use hydrogen instead of helium which hydrogen is highly flammable. For example, the German blimp Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, showing the danger. Ultimately, this idea was deemed too dangerous and impractical, leading to a different design for the top of the Empire State Building.
321	15154	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was strengthening the building's frame. This was necessary because the added pressure of the dirigible's load and wind needed to be transmitted all the way down to the foundation. The existing skeleton of the building had to be edited to accommodate these stresses. In fact, these edits cost over sixty thousand dollars. Another problem builders faced was constructing the mast itself. To give it a unique look, architects made the tower out of glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel. They had to place the machinery at the base of this tower to facilitate the mooring process. The builders also had to make sure it was accessible to passengers; they made sure luggage and people could go to and from the aircraft via elevators and walkways. These are two of the challenges builders faced in constructing the Empire State Building. Despite the mast being unused in the present day, the ambitious design and engineering feat make this building one of the most well-known buildings in the world.
322	15155	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle the builders faced was the harsh winds. The Empire State Building is so tall that the winds were very fast and it would constantly change direction due to violent air currents. This made it very hard to dock the dirigibles safely. Also another obstacle was the pedestrians and other buildings around the area. Most balloons were filled with hydrogen, which is highly flammable, and a leak would be catastrophic. If a dirigible caught fire or crashed, a lot of damage would be done to the city and its people. The structure of the building also proved to be an obstacle, as engineers worried about the added stress. The dirigibles were so large that the building's structure was at risk of failing under the immense weight and potentially destroying the building. The final obstacle the building faced was legal restrictions. The law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie to a building or even fly that low in an urban area. Although there were a few attempts to overcome these problems, the Empire State Building never was able to have dirigibles dock on it.
323	15156	6	3	"In the excerpt, there where many obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The problems where that the dirigible being ""held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"", and the wind pressure wouldn't help either, as stated earlier. Another issue was that, as said previously, ""most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium"", and consequently, ""hydrogen is highly flammable"". Also earlier, ""The owners of the empire state building realized how much worse,"" a accident could be ""if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as down town New York. These are the problems the builders faced, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the dirigible docking idea due to safety concerns and structural challenges."
324	15157	6	3	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast, written by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems with their ideas. The builders thought they would be able to make a successful landing dock for dirigibles. Everything they did was all planned right but when it came time to test it, it didn't work. There were quit a few problems with there idea of using the Empire State Building is a landing dock for dirigibles. One reason that this one not successful was because the dirigibles wern't able to get close enough to attach the building. In order for the dirigible to be ankered would be for a rope to be tied to some thing. But the balloons wern't able to get to close to the building because the point at the top of the building was making it too hard. If it got to close to the point, it could puncture the balloon which would not be could because the gas that holds it up would come out and the balloon would fall. There is one more major reason they're plan did not work. The other major reason would be because of the wind. the wind would get so wild the back of the blimp would sway back and forth, making it dangerous for passengers. They wouldn't be able to weigh it down with weights would be dangerous for the pedestrians down in the city. These are some of the major reasons why the plan to dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building would not work, showcasing the impracticality of the ambitious mooring mast concept.
325	15158	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in order to allow dirigibles to dock there. To start off, there was a lack of suitable landing area. This was a tough obstacle because the builders needed to think of a place that extremely large dirigibles could land while in a crowded place like New York City. Next, was figuring out a safe way of getting the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building. This was another tough obstacle because if the mast was just placed on the top of the building, it would add stress to the building's frame, which is dangerous. Lastly, and most importantly, was the problem of nature. At the top of the building there were constantly shifting wings due to violent air currents. This was an extremely dangerous obstacle because the winds could cause the dirigibles to be constantly moving and shaking. Also, if they were weighted down by lead weights to prevent them from being affected by the wind, the weights would be dangling above pedestrians on the street. To allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders overcame many different obstacles.
326	15159	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, builders faced many problems in allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. First, safety would be a large problem. Back then, most dirigibles used hydrogen (which is highly flammable) instead of helium to power them. This means that if there was a malfunction such as a fire, not only with the dirigible burst into flames, but the Empire State Building could too. Another obstacle builders had to confront was mother nature. According to paragraph 3 of the reading, the location of the Empire State building has ""violent air currents"" with shifting winds. This problem would cause the dirigible to not stay stable. Although solutions like lead weights being hung from the back of the dirigible were offered, this only lead to more problems. If the lead weight fell, where would it land? The answer would be in the streets of New York City where pedestrians could be harmed. The final obstacle builders would have had to get through if they continued their plans for the dirigibles would be a law. The law stated (according to the reading) that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. So in theory, all of the plans the builders of this concoction had to be put to rest due to the governments law. In conclusion, many problems arose as building, and plans to make the ""Dirigible dock"" were made, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the ambitious project due to safety concerns, environmental factors, and legal restrictions."
327	15160	6	3	Based on the excerpt, the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there would be that the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof because a thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications on the framework were contemplated to handle these stresses. The greatest obstacle to the mooring mast, however, was nature itself. The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, causing the back of the ship to swivel around and around the mooring mast, making the docking process quite treacherous and ultimately impractical.
328	15161	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First the stress of ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether,"" was a problem. So the steel frame of the building had to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the dirigibles and the immense weight they would impose. Next, they faced the fact that dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable and ""when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the Owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Ultimately, the greatest obstacle was the winds on top of the building that changed due to violent air currents. If you had a dirigible moored and weighted down with lead weights above pedestrians, it could lead to disaster. In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, builders realized too many obstacles interfered and it could never happen."
329	15162	6	3	"In the excerpt ""the Mooring Mast"", the author @ORGANIZATION2 explains some of the obstacles that the builders had to face in their attempt of allowing dirigibles dock on the mast of the Empire State Building. First of all, the dirigibles were big and heavy and needed space to land. @ORGANIZATION2 stated that ""some were... the same length as four blocks in New York City."" If the builders wanted to @CAPS1 accommodate dirigibles on top of the building, they would need a lot of space to build a big landing platform for a safe landing. Secondly, they decided that they could not land dirigibles on a flat roof and decided to tie it with a cable tether. The author says ""the architects could not simply drop the mooring mast on top of the... flat roof."" They realized that the weight of the dirigible would deform the building's structure and that the strong winds could cause damages down to the foundation of the building. In conclusion, the workers faced many obstacles in order for them to @CAPS1 accommodate dirigibles on top of the State holding."
330	15163	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while trying to build a dock for dirigibles. One problem was safety. While American dirigibles used helium, other countries filled their dirigibles with highly flammable hydrogen. If a dirigible were to ignite in a heavily populated area like New York City, the result would be deadly. Nature also caused problems with the mooring mast. The winds above the building were too strong and ever-changing, and could potentially destroy the dirigibles attempting to dock. Finally, federal laws stated that an aircraft could not dock that close to a building. These combined factors ultimately made it impossible for dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, rendering the initial vision impractical.
331	15164	6	3	Throughout the process of building the Empire State Building with dirigibles dock there were many complications. At THE BEGINNING the building was unable to simply put a mooring mast on top of the building. The roof was flat, therefore the dirigible would add stress to the building. They would need over $5 MILLION to modify the building framework. Then they realized that most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, hydrogen is highly flammable which would be unsafe. They ran into a problem with nature itself. At the top of the Empire State Building the winds constantly shifted because of the violent air currents. Even if they were to tether the mooring mast, the back of the ship would spin around and around the mooring mast. Therefore with people all over the streets in NEW YORK CITY this was neither possibly or safe. There was also an exisisting law against flying airships too low over urban areas. All this gave way to airplanes, so even though dirigibles didn't work it helped pave the way for advancements in aviation and airport technology.
332	15165	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that countries other than the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable; if it caught fire above a city, the results would be disastrous. Another obstacle was that at such a height, the winds would blow the back of the dirigible around, making docking incredibly difficult and unsafe. Perhaps the most obvious obstacle in allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building was the law that airships could not fly below a certain height over cities, which would have made approach and docking illegal. All of these obstacles combined to make the project impractical and impossible, ultimately leading to its abandonment.
333	15166	6	3	"Back in the roaring 1920s and 1930s, New York City was a popular place which needed to adapt to the ways of modernizing travel. A new and fashionable form of travel was the blimp, or the dirigible. These transatlantic balloons had nowhere to dock in the city, and solving that solution was harder than expected. Al Smith, architect of the Empire State Building decided that he could use the top of the tower as a mooring mast for these dirigibles. After adapting the entire building for the change, Smith ran into a few problems. The first city issue surfaced when a German dirigible exploded in New Jersey. This let Smith know that it would be a bad idea to allow any foreign blimps near as most non-American crafts were filled with ""hydrogen [which] is highly flammable,"" leaving possibility for catastrophe. Another snag was the ""winds on top of the building... shifting due to... air currents"" which would cause the dirigibles to freely and dangerously sway in the wind. With the wind, they could crash into towers and ""would be dangling above pedestrians."" Legal valves also came into play as there was a preexisting law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" which would make any dirigible activity with the Empire State Building downright illegal. Ultimately, the impracticality and danger led to the abandonment of the dirigible mooring mast, leaving the Empire State Building to serve other purposes."
334	15167	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in building a mooring mast for airships to dock at the top of the building. The stress and pressure of a thousand-foot dirigible docked at the top of the building was too great for the building's original framework to support, so they had to reinforce and strengthen the framework and base so the pressure would be transmitted to the building's foundation. Another obstacle was most dirigibles from outside the United States were filled with hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen was much more flammable, and hydrogen dirigibles, like the German dirigible Hindenburg, were destroyed in fire, and they didn't want that to happen over New York's population. The final obstacle was the violent and shifting air currents over the building. Even if the front of the dirigible or ""mast"" was tied to the mooring mast, the back would swivel around the mooring mast, buffeted by unpredictable winds. The many unforeseen obstacles of the mooring mast made it an impractical docking point for dirigibles. In the 1930s, after airplanes had become the preferred method of air travel, and dirigibles had disappeared from the skies, the ticketing and bagging rooms were turned into tourist and sightseer areas, repurposing the space for a more viable function."
335	15168	6	3	"When the builders of the Empire State Building were in the process of building the docking station they ran into many obstacles. One of these obstacles being the air currents at the top of the building. The dirigible would be unable to stay still and safely let off its passengers. Evidence to support this claim comes from the article itself when it says, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Another obstacle the builders faced was the law. This law prohibited airships from flying low in a populated area. Therefore an airship trying to dock at the Empire State Building would be breaking the law. This was explained in paragraph fifteen of the article when it said, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."" Furthermore, it became very dangerous to dock these dirigibles in a populated area or near a building because there was the threat of them bursting into flame, creating a safety hazard. Such as the dirigible Hindenburg in 1937. The article explains that the builders realized this new threat, ""... the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been..."" Therefore, many obstacles plagued the construction of the docks, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the original docking station concept."
336	15169	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The unforeseen safety issues lead to the downfall of the creative use for the building. ""The greatest reason was one of safety. Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@CAPS1). They saw some of the dangerous affect of hydrogen when the German dirigible the Hindenburg was destroyed in a fire, highlighting the catastrophic potential. ""Owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" (@CAPS1). Other problems that the builders of the building faced were those of mother nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@CAPS1). This made it hard for the dirigible to dock to the mast safely. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (@CAPS1), making passenger transfer extremely difficult and perilous. Not only was nature playing against the builders, but the law was also. This is almost negligence on the builders part to not realize that they would be breaking a law by constructing this mooring mast. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (@CAPS1). Although the idea for a dirigible mooring mast on top of the empire State building seemed innovative and practical, it was irrelevant due to the many obstacles that obstructed the builders of the Empire State Building, ultimately rendering the ambitious plan unfeasible."
337	15170	6	3	"By attempting to construct a mast on the Empire State Building, builders encountered all sorts of problems. The purpose of this mast was to allow dirigibles, or blimps, to dock. Many of these problems however, were the effect of the dirigible itself. In paragraph thirteen, line @NUM1, the author talks about some of the dangers of the dirigible, ""Most dirigibles... used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This flammability posed a significant risk. Another obstacle is location. It was thought to be very unsafe because if a blimp caught fire it would land in the middle of New York City, not some remote cornfield. This densely populated area heightened the potential for disaster. And finally, the winds changed frequently that high up. It was an unwise decision to dock at this area if the dirigible would be blown around the building, making docking maneuvers incredibly hazardous. Thus, the combination of flammable gas, a precarious location, and unpredictable winds ultimately rendered the dirigible docking plan impractical and unsafe."
338	15171	6	3	Al Smith was a guy who had an idea of making the world's tallest building, and he didn't give up. On December 11, 1929, he announced that the Empire State Building's goal height would reach 1,250 feet. He also wanted to involve transportation. The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the lack of landing area. Al Smith thought he could add a mooring mast to the top of the building and allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and let passengers on and off. One of the greatest obstacles to letting the dirigibles dock there was the weather, particularly strong winds. The dirigibles moored in open landing fields could weigh down, where it could dangle high above pedestrians on the street. There was also an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, further complicating the docking plans. Ultimately, these challenges proved too significant, and the dirigible docking idea was abandoned, demonstrating the impracticality of the concept.
339	15172	6	3	"Through life many people plan to make or build an amazing object but have to acomplish amazing feats in order to do this. In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, @ORGANIZATION1 plans on building the tallest building in the world, but in order to do this he has to defeat many obstacles that you and I may never even think of. On December 11, 1929 the Empire State building was announced the world's tallest building. In making this huge building there were many obstacles. One of the obstacles was allowing dirigibles to dock on the building. ""The greatest obstacle was nature itself. The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This quote shows that it may be unsafe to allow dirigibles to dock due to the winds. Another quote that shows an obstacle of having dirigibles docking at the empire state building is, ""an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas"". This quote shows that it might be illegal to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire state building, which would create legal issues and prevent the plan from succeeding. In life we defeat great obstacles but sometimes we cannot defeat the obstacles we face."
340	15173	6	3	In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, it describes the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph @NUM1 they described the greatest reason was one of safety because most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, posing a significant fire risk to the building and the city below. In paragraph @NUM2 they also describe another obstacle was nature itself because the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. Even dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighed down in the back with lead weights, this could be dangerous for pedestrians. In paragraph @NUM3 they describe another reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. These are some examples of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles docking there, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the ambitious mooring mast project.
341	15174	6	3	The Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some obstacles severely affected the building attempt of the dirigible dock. For instance, The Empire State building is located in a very dense urban location. At the time most dirigibles outside the United States used Hydrogen instead of Helium. The main difference between the two was that Hydrogen is more flammable than Helium. So if the Hydrogen from the dirigible were to ignite then a catastrophic fire would arise. The effects could be as devastating as the Hindenburg which ignited over Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937, instantly killing many and shocking the world. The result of the Hindenburg accident forced the architects and engineers to look for a safer, alternate solution. Explosive gases were not the only problem though. Strong, gustful winds were present at the top of the Empire State Building. If winds were to blow a docking dirigible off course then the outcome would be deadly. If the dirigibles caught fire or were blown off course while docking then the pedestrians on the ground level could be injured, which posed significant safety concerns that ultimately made the ambitious dirigible dock concept impractical.
342	15175	6	3	"Dirigibles, or blimps, were seen as the transportation of the future. In order to add height and yet serve a purpose, architects of the Empire State Building decided to build a mooring mast upon the building to accommodate ""aviation pioneers."" Although the mast was built and gave the building its desired height, the usage of it as a docking station for dirigibles would never be fulfilled. The obstacles that builders had in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock included the height of the building, wind speeds, and the safety of civilians. The height of the building was 1,250 feet, thus having violent shifts in air currents. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Dirigibles also used hydrogen for fuel and lead weights to be weighed down; however, by using the mast, hydrogen and the use of lead weights provided a safety hazard to civilians below. Builders had created the mooring mast to dock dirigibles, but the idea caused problems and was never fulfilled, ultimately proving to be an impractical vision given the inherent challenges."
343	15176	6	3	There were many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One of the reasons was that the dirigible hanging by one cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. This stress would cause the building's foundation to crack under the immense weight. This obstacle caused the architects to have to strengthen the foundation, this cost them over sixty thousand dollars in modifications to the original design. Another obstacle was they had to make another floor which would be used for passengers and would let elevators bring the passengers to the eighty-sixth floor, where their baggage and ticket area would be located for easy access. These observation areas were to double as the boarding area for dirigible passengers arriving or departing. Once this was done, they then had to complete the roof before the framing for the mooring mast could take place on top of the building. Another obstacle was nature itself; the winds at the top of the building were always shifting and unpredictable, and the dirigibles, that usually land in open fields, could be weighted down with lead weights to improve stability. However, this method could not be used at the Empire State Building, where they would be hanging precariously over pedestrians on the streets below. Another obstacle was that there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, creating a legal hurdle. This would make it illegal for dirigibles to tie up or even approach the Empire State Building. All these many obstacles ultimately led to the abandonment of the ideas of dirigibles and the mooring mast, for the era of the dirigibles had disappeared, making the concept impractical.
344	15177	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there; it was a futile effort. They tried a numerous amount of different ways to approach this idea. There were a few different theories on what would be best and how to develop the Mooring Mast by Al Smith and John Tauranac. Each man had a different thought on how the whole structure would turn out. The architects designed a new glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that ranged from the bottom to the top of the Empire State Building. This structure helped support the mooring area, where the dirigibles were docked. But the fate of the Mast was not too bright. ""The Mooring Mast of the Empire State Building was never destined to fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" This statement is utterly true and shows the work of the architects was never fully planned and overlooked for the Mast to be durable, leading to its ultimate failure."
345	15178	6	3	Based on the excerpt the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were the following. One obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. The greater obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself; the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The dirigible couldn't do anything even if tethered to the mooring mast; the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast, making passenger transfer exceptionally difficult and dangerous. Thus, despite the ambitious plan, the unpredictable winds proved to be an insurmountable challenge.
346	15179	6	3	The installation of a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building would have made the building, as well as the city of New York, incredibly important to modern travel in the 1930s. Alas, many difficult obstacles made the mast impossible to complete. First, to get the mast to the top, the building's frame had to be strengthened and reinforced, which was painstaking and expensive, requiring significant time and resources. Second, the builders had to deal with the possibility of the blimps exploding, a catastrophic event that posed a substantial risk. Another obstacle the builders faced was nature. With constantly shifting, violent winds at the top of the building, the zeppelin would sway and swivel around the mast, making it difficult and dangerous to unload passengers and cargo. With high winds, the zeppelin could even detach from its mooring and fall onto the city below, potentially killing hundreds. Lastly, the builders failed to take into account the law that forbade dirigibles to fly too close to urban areas. This law made it illegal for any blimp to get near the Empire State Building, let alone dock on it. The thought of a mooring mast on the Empire State Building was a fantastic idea, albeit one destined to fail from the beginning.
347	15180	6	3	"The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2 is mainly about builders and architects attempting to put a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building in New York. At first, the main idea of the mooring mast was to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast to drop off and bring on passengers. The mooring mast was needed because ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the @ORGANIZATION1 flat roof. A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" (paragraph @NUM1). One reason why this plan did not work out was because it was not safe, because the hydrogen that dirigibles use is highly flamable (and this could cause a serious fire). Also, if it was a windy day, the dirigibles could get pushed around by the winds. To stop this, they have lead weights to weight them down, but they cannot use these with all of the people and other buildings around. Also, dirigibles could not fly too low over these kinds of areas. Ultimately, although the plan did not work, it was better to prioritize the safety and well-being of everyone involved."
348	15181	6	3	Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, both during construction and after. During the creation of the mooring mast, the architects had to figure out how to place it on top of the building, because the stress of the load and wind pressure would add stress to the building's frame; instead, they had to transmit the load and pressure to the foundation, modifying and strengthening the steel frame of the building. Builders also wanted the mast to be aesthetically pleasing, needing to make the tower of shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel, rising to a conical roof and illuminated from inside. After the creation of the mooring mast, more difficulties arose. The safety of the mast was an issue, as the hydrogen-using blimps outside the U.S. were highly flammable, and the German dirigible Hindenburg caught fire as a result. The winds at the top of the building, too, created danger, for they constantly shifted from the violent air currents. Dirigibles would swivel around the mooring mast. Another obstacle was the law forbidding airships from flying too low over urban areas. It would be illegal, therefore, for a dirigible to tie up to the building or even fly too close to the area, making the dirigible docking plan ultimately impractical.
349	15182	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast"", by Popular Mechanics it revealed many problems with docking dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building. Al Smith, the former New York governor and figurehead working on the Empire State Building thought the mooring mast would go up with no problems. Architects soon realized that the mooring mast would add stress to the building's framework and cost $500,000 in modifications. After seeing what happened to the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" in Lakehurst, New Jersey, Architects soon realized that having dirigibles filled with highly-flammable hydrogen over the densely populated New York City wasn't a good idea. Nature itself would not allow the mooring mass to be built. There were such violent air currents at the one thousand and fifty foot tall Empire State Building altitude that made Architects aware that this idea couldn't be upheld. The dirigible would swivel around because it couldn't be weighed down like in open landing fields. They couldn't use these weights because having weights suspended over pedestrians' heads was neither practical nor safe. There is also a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal to try and dock a dirigible on top of the Empire State Building. In the end, the idea of having dirigibles dock on the Empire State Building and become the new way of modern transportation was soon abolished."
350	15183	6	3	While attempting to let dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. For one thing, there wasn't a whole lot of landing room in New York City for them, especially considering the wind conditions at that height, which ultimately made things tougher. Also, they were forced to put more work into the building by strengthening and modifying the steel frame of it to accommodate the new situation of supporting airships. A lot of money was spent on these new renovations, over sixty thousand dollars for materials and labor. This was done mainly to reduce stress on the building's frame caused by the docking process. But overall, despite these challenges, they managed to get it all done, and make their way through these tricky obstacles.
351	15184	6	3	Al Smith had an ambitious plan to put his Empire State Building on top of New York. He envisioned the skyscraper as a dirigible port and a future transport hub. Technical limitations eventually proved insurmountable though. First, dirigibles had to deal with docking in an urban area. Dirigibles normally dropped lead weights to secure their landings, but this would be impractical when people were on the streets below. Wind was also a major problem because it made the blimp difficult to stabilize in the air. The wind would be ever more problematic in the city as if a Dirigible hit a building it would puncture and fall into New York city. Neither of the Dirigibles that tried to moor could because of wind and other buildings. As stylish as landing in the middle of New York City would have been, safety problem could not be fixed and there were too many people around to risk it.
352	15185	6	3	the obstacles the builder of the Empire State Building faced were... When they were planning to build a mast for the Dirigibles, they encountered a significant challenge. When they first tried to build it they figured out that the structure of the Empire State building could not hold the mast. The Empire State building had to support both the mast and the Dirigibles, adding immense strain. Then at the end of the story they figured out there was no way to do it, as the forces involved were simply too great for the building to withstand, making the Dirigible mast ultimately unfeasible.
353	15186	6	3	"Whenever architectural work is put in act, thoughts of the potential consequences should be thought out beforehand. In ""The Mooring Mast,"" the builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The blimps consist of dangerous chemicals and, ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium,"" and hydrogen is extremely flammable. A possibility of flames could result in a ruined building, and even worse, a destroyed city. The highly flammable nature of hydrogen posed a significant safety threat. Although fires were a problem to consider, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" This building is extremely high in the sky, therefore the winds get quite brutal. If a blimp was tied to the mast, the back of the ship would continuously swivel and ruin the fabric of the aircraft. The strong winds at that altitude made docking maneuvers incredibly difficult and hazardous. A mooring mast was just not a bright idea for a large city like New York. The population was too large, and the area was too crowded. The obstacles the architects faced were serious, and they helped the team to kill the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. Ultimately, the combination of safety concerns and practical difficulties proved insurmountable, leading to the abandonment of the mooring mast concept."
354	15187	6	3	"Many obstacles were faced by the builders of the Empire State Building as stated in the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2. These obstacles included safety and availability. The idea of being able to dock a dirigible to a building in the middle of a densely populated city such as New York was extremely unsafe between the explosive tendencies of Hydrogen and the unmanageable winds. With the winds the dirigible would continuously move around the mast creating an extremely unsafe environment for all. Availability would also be put into question, in paragraph fifteen @ORGANIZATION2 tells about the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles @CAPS1 unable to dock due to the unavailable route of safe entrance. This unavailability made traveling to the mooring mast almost impossible, effectively rendering the mast useless for its intended purpose. The obstacles in the mooring mast include availability and safety."
355	15188	6	3	There are many obstacles with the docking of the dirigibles, for example in the text it talked about if the accident had taken place over @CAPS1 it would have been a lot worse because New York is a populated city. Another obstacle was the height, as mentioned in the text, and anything could happen at that height, making maneuvering difficult in unpredictable weather conditions. So those are some obstacles in the way of the docking of the dirigibles.
356	15189	6	3	"In the article, The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION1 was determined to make the Empire State Building the tallest building. To make the Empire State Building taller than the Chrysler building, Smith decided to create a ""mooring mast"" where dirigibles could land and become ""transportation of the future."" However, the dirigibles never landed, because there were many obstacles in landing a dirigible on the Empire State Building. Many Dirigibles that are from outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and because the Empire State Building is in New York City, it would be hazardous for a hydrogen filled dirigible to land, in a densely populated area, like New York City. Another obstacle faced is the weather at the top of the Empire State Building. The winds are much stronger than down the streets. If the dirigible were able to land, the winds would be blowing the dirigible all around and out of control. Finally, it is illegal to have airships flying too low to the ground and near people. By having a dirigible land on the mast, it would break the law, due to the low altitude required for such a maneuver in a congested urban environment. There were too many obstacles for Al Smith's idea to become reality. Ultimately, these insurmountable challenges ensured that the mooring mast remained a symbolic gesture, rather than a functional transportation hub."
357	15190	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several challenges in building a dock for dirigibles. They would not be able to simply place a mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building. The thousand-foot dirigible held by a single cable would make the frame very unsturdy. With the weight of the dirigible and the wind pressure it would have to get transmitted to eleven hundred feet, where the foundation is. They would need to make the frame stronger to withstand the stress which would cost over sixty thousand dollars. In the end the mooring mast never was made because of safety, the unpredictable nature of the weather, and of the law itself. It was unsafe due to the highly flammable dirigibles putting the high populated region in danger. The winds would shift too constantly and violently and be too very difficult to control the dirigible. Also, the law that airships flying too low over urban areas would have made it illegal. Ships would not be able to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. Overall, there were too many obstacles that made it impossible for the engineers to build a mooring mast, thus ending the ambitious plan.
358	15191	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a number of different obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to land there, the most difficult of which were the urban location, money, and the weather. The urban location was an obstacle for the builders because there are laws against airships flying too low over a densely populated area, and you can't weigh the airship down like you could if it was on the ground because the weights would be dangling over the city. This raised safety concerns that were difficult to resolve. The second obstacle was money because it was becoming increasingly expensive to pay for all of the modifications to make the mooring mast the reality. The additional costs strained the project's budget. The third and most dangerous obstacle was the weather because wind and other various kinds of storms can control the airship and make it difficult for it to dock at the Empire State Building. These unpredictable elements posed a significant threat to the entire operation. Therefore, the obstacles of the urban location, money, and the weather made it virtually impossible for the mooring mast to be constructed.
359	15192	6	3	The dirigibles were not able to dock on the mast of the Empire State Building for obvious reasons. When the construction workers were building the mast, they didn't realize how dangerous it was having a dirigible landing on the top of the building. There were a few cautions that the workers realized. First off, if the dirigible catches on fire like the one in Lakehurst, New Jersey, then a lot of people would be at risk because it is such a big city with massive amounts of people. Another reason they realized after was that it was too dangerous for the dirigible to land there due to the high swirling winds. If they tried landing there, but the violent winds wouldn't let them, then it would not be the least bit safe. Therefore, after considering the fire hazard and the strong winds, the workers of the Empire State building faced obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there.
360	15193	6	3	"There Are Several things that Are worry Some About dirigibles docking there. One of them was the fact that ""The dirigibles would sway in the wind As the passengers walked down A Gangplank"". This would be unsafe because As it sways, it could knock the passengers off the plank and cause them to fall, thus highlighting a major safety concern during passenger disembarkation."
361	15194	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were: The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast, making passenger transfer dangerous and impractical. Adding to these concerns, the United States used hydrogen rather than helium for lift, and hydrogen is highly flammable, posing a significant safety risk in the event of any mishap during docking. These factors combined ultimately rendered the dirigible docking plan unfeasible.
362	15195	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced included that their expanded use in aviation was hindered by the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith saw an opportunity for his Empire State Building. A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on. Dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mast, envisioning a solution that would make his building a central hub for this new form of transportation.
363	15196	6	3	"The main obstacle in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building's Mooring Mast was safety. ""Most dirigibles... used hydrogen... and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The possibility of even a small leak turning into a catastrophic fire was a constant concern. ""The owners... realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above downtown New York."" If an accident were to happen with a dirigible it would be putting hundreds of people's lives at risk. That is why this idea was unpractical and unsafe. Another obstacle in allowing dirigibles to moor at the Empire State Building's mast was nature itself. ""The winds on top were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would cause the back of the ship to swivel around the mast, making passenger transfer extremely difficult and dangerous. Lead weights could be used, but that was neither practical nor safe where they would be dangling high above pedestrians, posing a threat of falling. Ultimately, the combination of these safety and environmental concerns made the mooring mast concept unworkable."
364	15197	6	3	"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, there were obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. This was a problem because as it says in paragraph @NUM1, line four, ""hydrogen is highly flammable."" The greatest obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock was nature itself. Nature itself would be an obstacle because ""dirigibles moored in open fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using them at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" These were some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, ultimately rendering the mooring mast concept unworkable."
365	15198	6	3	Based on the excerpt, the builders faced many obstacles trying to get dirigibles allowed to dock on the Empire State Building. The builders faced obstacles like the lack of land area in New York, as stated. A big problem they faced was that they could not just land right on the flat roof, and another problem mentioned was that the cable at the top of the building added stress to the structure eleven hundred feet below; some of this work cost over sixty thousand dollars. Problems with safety included the lead weight dangling high above pedestrians on the street, which was neither practical nor safe. Adding to safety concerns, Hydrogen in these dirigibles was highly flammable. There was also an existing law against flying airships above urban areas. These significant hurdles ultimately made the ambitious plan impractical.
366	15199	6	3	"The Empire State Building was an incredible building without the idea of attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. But with this idea of this mooring mast it braught up many obstacles like the safety of the public. L¸sted states ""Most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flamable."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) This statement proves that if the dirigible were catch fire like the accident in Lakehurst, New Jersey, then the citizens of New York's lives would be at stake. This safety hazard is one of the builder's problems. These archatets faced many challenges with this mooring mast idea. Including the dangerous factor of nature. L¸sted states ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This is extremely dangerous because the dirigibles start to move around the building while docked causing hazardous menuvers and putting pedestrian's lives at risk. The architects' challenges in addressing these safety and logistical concerns ultimately proved too significant to overcome. For this mooring idea, it is too dangerous for the public and the city of New York."
367	15200	6	3	In the process of building the dock for dirigibles, builders faced some obstacles. The first obstacle builders faced, was the lack of a suitable landing area. If there wasn't an area to land, there was no reason or way to build it. Also, the builders would have to remodel the whole building to accommodate the massive structure. After the building was framed to the 85th floor, they couldn't build the mast until the roof was done, so the project took even longer to finish. The greatest obstacle the mast dealt with was nature itself, because the winds on the tops of the buildings were constantly shifting, so there was no way for a dirigible to land or stay in place without crashing. The final obstacle builders faced was a law against airships flying too low to urban areas, which made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up or even approach the building. As you can see, there were many obstacles, and the mast wasn't useful, as it turned out. It was a great idea, conceived with ambition. But in my opinion it was a waste of time and money, given the insurmountable challenges.
368	15201	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there included the high winds at that altitude, making it extremely difficult for the airships to securely hook up to the mooring gear. Another serious concern was the highly flammable nature of the hydrogen or other gases used to inflate dirigibles, posing a significant fire hazard to the city should an accident occur. Lastly, there were also legal issues, as maritime laws prohibited any ship from tying up to the building or even closely approaching the structure, thus making the dirigible docking concept ultimately unworkable.
369	15202	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was safety because outside the U.S dirigibles were using hydrogen instead of helium, a safer alternative, which is highly flammable. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting because of violent air currents, making docking incredibly dangerous. One more obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The law said it was illegal for a ship to approach or even be tied up to a building, further complicating the ambitious plan. Thus, a combination of safety concerns, unpredictable weather, and legal restrictions ultimately prevented the Empire State Building from becoming a successful airship terminal.
370	15203	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Popular Mechanics, the builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. First, they risked having dirigibles from places outside the U.S. cause a fire. Popular Mechanics states ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (Popular Mechanics. 1). This would become a big issue because they would run the risk of having foreign dirigibles pass through New York's highly dense air and inadvertently cause a fire. By building a loading dock, they were potentially harming the area of downtown New York. Second, another obstacle that would get in the way of building the dock was nature. Builders said ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (Popular Mechanics. 2). Even if they attempted to tie down the dirigibles, there was a chance that the back would move around dangerously. Given that the winds would be too much to handle, they brought up alternatives like lead weights, but this would become a hazard for pedestrians below. Finally, there was a law that prevented any airships from flying too low. The article reads ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (Popular Mechanics. 3). The law made it extremely hard for the builders. The overall idea was to have airships land on the building, and this obstacle made it an impossibility. The idea of a dock vanished, as it was too much of a risk to pursue. Nevertheless the excerpt by Popular Mechanics in ""The Mooring Mast"" describes the challenges put upon builders to build a dock, ultimately showing why the ambitious plan was abandoned."
371	15204	6	3	The obstacles of getting the dirigibles to be able to dock at the Empire State Building was that they couldn't put the fuel on top of the building. Putting a mooring mast on top of the roof would make it very unstable and put a lot of pressure on it. For this to happen they had to modify the structure of the roof, which ended up costing over $2 million. After successfully building that, they had another obstacle. It was trying to figure out how the dirigibles wouldn't move around with so much wind currents at that altitude. Ultimately, they never figured out a reliable solution to counteract the strong and unpredictable wind conditions, and the ambitious dirigible docking idea eventually disappeared.
372	15205	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, the designing as well as the cost of this project could encounter problems. For instance, adding a mooring mast could ""add stress to the building's frame."" If the mast interfered with the building's frame, then changing the building's material could cost ""over sixty thousand dollars!"" In addition, safety was a major component when trying to construct the mooring mast. For example, ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen...and hydrogen is highly flammable."" New York is a very populated area, which means when building a mooring mast, safety must be considered. Lastly, there were restrictions on airships flying too close to cities, as an existing law prohibited ""airships flying too low over urban areas."" Ultimately, when constructing the mooring mast, many builders were blind to the potential problems, which contributed to the project being unsuccessful."
373	15206	6	3	One of the obstacles they faced were the strong winds. Because of the violent air currents the winds were constantly shifting. The dirigible would constantly be moving around. They couldn't even weigh it down with ballast, because there would be people far below them, and the ballast could fall and injure them. A second obstacle they faced were the laws against it. There were existing laws about airships flying too low over the city. It was illegal for the airships to even come into the city limits. Those two obstacles stop them using the dock for dirigibles, effectively preventing their project from moving forward.
374	15207	6	3	"Based on the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced to allow dirigibles to dock there were the strong wind currents, the fact that dirigibles were very flammable, and that they were very large and hard to keep still. In paragraph @NUM1 it states that the use of hydrogen rather than helium, due to its explosive nature, should have stopped the project. Also in paragraph @NUM2 it states that the biggest obstacle was nature itself, with unpredictable weather patterns and powerful gusts making docking a perilous endeavor. For the reasons above, and particularly the volatile nature of hydrogen and the challenges posed by the elements, those were some of the significant obstacles builders faced in attempting to have dirigibles dock there."
375	15208	6	3	"During the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, builders faced many obstacles. One obstacle builders faced was the building's **structural** **frame**. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the [Empire State Building] held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's Frame."" Another obstacle in the way was nature itself. The reason was that the winds on top of the Empire State Building was always changing because of violent air currents. This was dangerous because ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" **Furthermore**, there is a law in the United States against airships Flying too low over urban areas."" This would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the [Empire State Building] or even approach the area. Many more obstacles were faced during the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State **Building**, but that didn't stop the workers from doing their job."
376	15209	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents causing the dirigible's back to swivel around the mooring mast, making docking incredibly dangerous. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen... hydrogen is highly flammable."" The Hindenburg disaster highlighted this risk; if a blimp blew up over downtown New York, tons of lives would be lost, a huge risk associated with the mooring mast. ""Was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law further complicated matters, effectively preventing dirigibles from docking at the mooring mast legally. All of those obstacles contributed to the mooring mast being used only for show, a failed experiment despite its contribution to the world's tallest building."
377	15210	6	3	In the excerpt the engineers were faced with multiple issues on their theory. It took lots of time for people to begin realizing reality. For example, Airships had a law preventing them from getting to low to urban areas. Also they realized major wind would play a negative role. Wind would cause the airships to swing around all Docked. They thought to way down the rear of the ship, but soon realized that is unsafe over many people below. They had heard of a airship in New Jersey was Destroyed by fire, Due to its hydrogen, Also unsafe in New York with such a dense population. Overall they began to realize saftey issues and how unpractical it was to do all of this.
378	15211	6	3	"The idea of allowing dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State building was unrealistic because there was a lack of identification of possible flaws in this plan. As a new form of transportation, dirigibles were not safe. This was proven true when the German dirigible, ""Hindenburg"", exploded in 1937. In addition, a more significant obstacle that was not addressed when the plan was created was the problem with its location. In the crowded streets of New York City, suspending flammable dirigibles above the population is unsafe. This location is also an obstacle because of the equipment needed to land the dirigible: lead weights. The use of lead weights to weigh down the dirigibles is unimaginable with the possible dangerous situations it could create. The creators of this idea solely designed this system on top of the Empire State building to incorporate a futuristic form of transportation to make the building more unique, but it was clear the risks were too great. The Empire State building builders encountered many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there because the concept was far past the capabilities of their age, and ultimately, the idea was abandoned due to its impracticality and inherent dangers."
379	15212	6	3	Some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced are dirigibles use hydrogen to float. Hydrogen is a highly flammable gas and if it was ignited it was cause a lot of property damage. Also at 1,250 ft there is a lot of wind. The dirigible would blow around the building causing unnatural stress to the building. It would be very difficult to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, given these significant safety and structural concerns.
380	15213	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In designing the mast, the steel frame of the State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new siteation, $2 million worth of modifications were made to the building's framework. Rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself. The mooring mast failed. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Weather, such as violent air currents, were the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mast, ultimately rendering the docking plan impractical.
381	15214	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced is that the architects initially designed the Empire State Building to accommodate dirigibles. The architects planned to have a thousand-foot dirigible mast at the top of the building, held by a cable tether. These dirigibles would have to contend with significant wind pressure, approximately eleven hundred feet below. Ensuring the frame of the Empire State Building was strong enough to withstand these forces required modifications costing over sixty thousand dollars. Ultimately, the architects recognized the impracticality of the dirigible mooring concept and changed the design, which made something new. Thus, one of the most difficult obstacles of building the Empire State Building was the initial attempt to make it suitable for dirigibles, highlighting the challenges of adapting innovative ideas to practical construction.
382	15215	6	3	"During the construction of the dirigible dock at the Empire State Building, architects and builders were faced with many obstacles. Before the mooring mast was installed at the top of the building, it became evident that ""the stress of the dirigible's load... would have been transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"" (paragraph @NUM1). This meant that changes would need to be made in the framework in order to support the weight, requiring significant reinforcement to the building's structure. In addition, safety, weather, and legal issues were at hand. Filled with flamable gas, there was always a risk of a dirigible catching fire, and in an urban area the damage would be extremely bad. Winds at the top of the building were also dangerous. Air currents were ""violent"" and ""even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around"" (paragraph @NUM2). Normally, the ships would be weighted down, but, again, this was not possible in a city. The last issue builders faced was the law ""against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM3). Although there was a law clearly against it, two dirigibles attempted to dock. Both attempts were failures and it became clear that the Empire State Building would not be able to serve as a dirigible landing, ultimately rendering the mooring mast a largely symbolic feature."
383	15216	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. For example, the building had to be reframed because its original frame could not support the weight of a dirigible on top of it, requiring significant redesign and added expense. Also, the materials inside dirigibles are highly flammable, like hydrogen, so an accident above an urban area that's highly populated would have been costly and fatal, presenting a major safety hazard. Another obstacle was the wind; since the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, the dirigible would be swiveling around and unstable, thus making the idea for docking dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building unpractical and unsafe, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the concept.
384	15217	6	3	The dirigibles faced some problems when they tried to dock them. The first reason would be that flying an airship that low over an urban area is against the law. Even though it is against the law, they tried it anyways and faced more problems, such as the winds. The one time that they tried, they couldn't dock it because the winds were too strong, making it impossible to safely moor the large airship.
385	15218	6	3	The architects and builders of the Empire State Building ran into a few problems when searching for a way to allow dirigibles to dock there. The architects knew they couldn't simply drop a mooring mast on the building's roof because it would be able to support it. The architects also knew that if they attached the dirigible to the mooring mast with a single cable tether would only add stress to the frame. To fix this problem the building's steel frame would need to be modified and strengthened to support the mooring mast and dirigible, ultimately proving too costly and complex to implement practically.
386	15219	6	3	Based on the excerpt, the dirigibles were not ever able to dock atop the Empire State building because it was a question of safety. The passage reads that most dirigibles from outside the United States are filled with hydrogen, which is flammable. This caused the Hindenburg, a German-made vessel, to burst into flames in New Jersey, and when this happened, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had happened in the densely populated New York City. Also, this was a question of safety because the winds on the top of the building would blow the dirigible all around, making docking incredibly dangerous. Lastly, there is a law prohibiting the flight of airships in low urban areas, so the ships could not fly in New York City, further preventing any potential docking attempts and solidifying the decision to abandon the original plan.
387	15220	6	3	In the article, The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the author talks about the many obstacles builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building. The first obstacle they faced involved dropping the mast onto the building's flat roof. This task would not be easy because using a single cable to lower the mast would add a great deal of stress to the building's frame. Another problem they faced was nature. The violent winds would cause the dirigible to swivel around the mast, making docking difficult. The greatest obstacle involved safety. Lots of blimps outside of the United States use highly flammable hydrogen, rather than helium. Hydrogen makes the dirigibles more likely to cause an explosion, and risk many lives of the people of New York. Lastly, existing laws in New York prohibited the balloons to dock. Airships were flying dangerously close over urban areas, posing a risk to the population. Many obstacles were faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building that were mentioned in the article, The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the docking plan.
388	15221	6	3	The idea of dirigibles being able to dock at such an altitude to begin with was foolish. First off, trying to tie a thousand-foot dirigible to a building by a single tether adds huge stress to the building's frame. They were able to fix that problem, but the main issue they couldn't fix was mother nature. The wind speed at that height is incredibly violent and would cause the ship to swivel around and around the mooring mast. Overall, the project was just doomed to fail from the start because these airships were simply too unwieldy to effectively manage in real-world conditions.
389	15222	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced a multitude of obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was nature itself. According to the text, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These unpredictable gusts would buffet the massive airships, making the already delicate maneuver of approaching the mooring mast incredibly dangerous. The wind would make it difficult for the dirigible to get close enough to the mooring mast to get tied up, and even after it is tied up the wind would cause it to keep moving around the mooring mast making it impossible for passengers to exit. Another obstacle in the way of allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building is a pre-existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. In the text it states, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area,"". This is a very black and white problem against allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. A final, and perhaps greatest obstacle against allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building is safety. In the excerpt it states, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This creates safety hazards not only for passengers and employee's of the dirigible but also the densely populated area below, that is downtown New York. The potential for disaster, given a spark or accident, was simply too great to ignore. Ultimately, these significant challenges, ranging from unpredictable weather to legal restrictions and critical safety concerns, rendered the ambitious dirigible docking plan for the Empire State Building impractical and ultimately unfeasible."
390	15223	6	3	"In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, it describes many ways the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. It was hard enough for the builders to build the Empire State Building but on top of that they must make a mooring mast at the top. Four term governor of New York Al Smith said it best, ""One set of engineers here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement and the Government people in Washington are figuring out some safe way of mooring airships to this mast."" Another obstacle builders faced was having a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, only held by a single cable tether, was simply not safe. Given the height and potential sway, such an arrangement raised serious safety concerns. With this being said, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened, costing over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications. This significant expense underscored the complexity of the mooring project. No matter how the builders built the Empire State Building they still face nature as an obstacle. High winds at that altitude posed a constant threat. These are examples builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, showcasing the ambitious and ultimately impractical nature of the endeavor."
391	15224	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, there were many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. Some of these obstacles include poor designing, nature, and lack of landing area. Due to the poor designing of Al Smith the Age of Dirigibles had a concern on where to land them. The Empire State Building was designed without fully considering the practicalities of dirigible docking. Nature itself was a big obstacle as well. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The wind made this hard for the dirigibles to land, creating hazardous conditions for both the airships and the building. The last obstacle was the lack of landing area for these enormous balloons. The limited space atop the skyscraper made maneuvering and securing the large airships incredibly difficult. Once Al Smith saw the opportunity to land the dirigibles on the Empire State Building, he took it, despite these substantial challenges. Ultimately, the combination of design flaws, unpredictable weather, and insufficient space proved too difficult to overcome, and the mooring mast idea was abandoned, showing even great ideas can fall short when faced with reality."
392	15225	6	3	"Allowing a dirigible to dock upon the top of the Empire State Building would leave architects faced with challenging scenarios. Adding a thousand-foot dirigible onto the top of the building would add stress to the frame. A single cable tether to the blimp would not help the stress. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" (L¸sted. @NUM1) The frame of the Building would have to be modified to accommodate this new situation. The greatest reason why it was never fully constructed was because of safety. Most dirigibles outside the U. S. used hydrogen rather than helium. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire... The owners realized how much worse have it been taking place above a densely populated area."" (L¸sted. @NUM2). This makes travel outside the @LOCATION1 with dirigibles more difficult, due to safety concerns surrounding hydrogen. Nature itself was a great obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast. The back of the ship will swivel around and around the mast cause of winds. ""The winds on top of the building shifts due to violent air currents."" (L¸sted, @NUM3). This wasn't practical nor safe for passengers or crew members. These obstacles leaves builders faced with unrealized challenges to overcome, ultimately making the concept infeasible."
393	15226	6	3	"Builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles when trying to dock dirigibles. One obstacle in docking dirigibles was the framework of the building. ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" This shows the amount of work that needed to be done just on the structure of the building. Another hardship was that most dirigibles outside of the United States were filled with highly flamable hydrogen rather than helium. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst on May 6, 1937, the owners of the empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area."" This incident highlighted how dangerous the hydrogen could be. Lastly, dirigibles could be weighed down by led weights. ""using these at the Empire State Building, would be dangling over pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" This showed that if the lead weights dropped they could kill someone. Many hardships were brought about trying to dock dirigibles at the empire state building. These significant structural changes, coupled with safety concerns, ultimately made the docking idea impractical."
394	15227	6	3	And the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges in order to add the mast to the building. They needed to consult with experts and learn all they could about how dirigibles themselves worked, including the nuances of mooring and disembarkation. It took engineers in New York and government workers all the way in Washington to piece together a plan on how to make it work. Just adding the mast would never work. Keeping it tethered by one cable would add a ton of stress to the framework, so all of the steel frame needed to be strengthened to accommodate the immense forces. Making the mast appealing to look at also took resources, as aesthetic considerations were paramount for such an iconic structure. Ultimately though, all the plans fell through. Nature had been the biggest problem. When currents are violent up in the air around the mast, it would cause the blimp to swing around dangerously. Had a ship crashed, hundreds of people in urban New York would be crushed. The project had to be scrapped, with the mast becoming a purely decorative addition, a testament to ambition thwarted by the realities of nature and safety concerns.
395	15228	6	3	"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. According to the author, ""... was destined to never fulfill its purpose [Empire State building being a dock for dirigibles], for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" As the author points out, there were many problems with this idea. The reasons were: safety, strong winds, and laws prohibiting this to happen. The safety issue was that the dirigibles used hydrogen which was highly flammable. In fact the Hindenburg was destroyed by a fire, highlighting the very real dangers of using this gas. If a dirigibles burst into flames while near the Empire State Building, it would be very harmful to the many people in the city around the building. Strong winds were another problem because the Empire State Building is so high, the winds at the mooring station would be violent and unpredicting. This would make it difficult to land at the mooring station and if it successfully did attach, the back end of the dirigibles would be blown around by the wind. The final problem was that there was a law forbidding aircraft to be a certain distance from a city. This law was trying to prevent aircraft from crashing into city. These laws made the docking of dirigibles not only dangerous but also illegal. With all of these problems, it is clear that this plan could never have worked effectively."
396	15229	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced many challenges in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was that putting the mast on the Empire State building then having a giant dirigible moor on to it would cause stress on the building and could pull the mast right off, causing it to weigh the dirigible down, leading to potential death and destruction for people and buildings. Another obstacle was timing the construction right. They didn't want the mast to be done when the whole building was only on floor @NUM1 out of 102, as the structure needed to be sufficiently complete to support the mooring mast and the forces exerted by a massive airship. These considerable engineering and logistical hurdles ultimately contributed to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan.
397	15230	6	3	Not everyone can invent new ways of transportation for the future. Al Smith learned that the hard way when he hired a team of builders to install landing docks for dirigibles on the Empire State Building. The team ran into numerous obstacles that caused problems and derailed their progress. One problem that arose was that the weight of the dirigible would add stress to the building's frame, which was only reinforced by steel. Another issue was safety, as a misplaced spark could cause disaster. Dirigibles from outside the United States ran on hydrogen instead of helium, which is highly flammable. The most important problem was nature. Wind made maneuvering difficult, and violent currents could be potentially fatal to passengers and pedestrians. They also cannot fly too close to the ground in urban, populated areas. Although the idea of the Empire State Building being used as an airdock was innovative, it was not practical or well thought out, ultimately proving to be an unfeasible venture.
398	15231	6	3	One obstacle that the builders faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was the lack of a suitable landing area. New York City is full of buildings, and there is not a lot of flat ground to land a dirigible. The builders' second obstacle was that they couldn't find a way to get the mooring mast on top of the building. The builders would need to make a stronger building frame so the mast could safely be on the top of the building without adding stress to the frame. Another obstacle that the builders faced was nature. The wind at the top of the building was very unpredictable and strong at times. The back of the dirigible would move from the wind, even if it was tied to the building. The last reason was that there was a law that wouldn't allow the dirigibles to fly that low over an urban area. These factors, combined with safety concerns and logistical challenges, ultimately meant that dirigibles could not dock at the Empire State Building.
399	15232	6	3	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted the builder of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigible to dock there. For example ""the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below,"" which describes that the problem that the builders would have to face if they applied the mast and with the load of the dirigible and the wind pressure would mess up the foundation of the building. So the builders needed to find a way to not ruin the foundation of the Empire State Building, a challenge requiring significant engineering solutions. Another example is ""The steal frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened."" This evidence explains that if the mast was to be place the builders would have to strengthen the entire building so there would be no problems with the mast. These issues highlight the substantial structural modifications needed to accommodate the mooring mast."
400	15233	6	3	Based on the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, the building of the Empire State Building had many obstacles the builders had to overcome. Some practical obstacles in building this landmark was the law against airships flying low, the complete dirigible mooring equipment wasn't installed, and greatest obstacle of all was nature surrounding the Empire State Building. The first obstacle builders had to overcome is the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The problem with flying too low is the dirigibles couldn't even try to attempt to reach the building. In December 1930, one dirigible approached the mast, but couldn't get close enough fearing the forceful winds would cause it to run into the sharp spires. As if that wasn't a problem, the dirigible mooring equipment wasn't even installed which meant the newspapers being delivered would have to be caught by dangling ropes from the dirigible, which could get tiring. The greatest obstacle of all was nature. Winds at the top of the building were really strong due to the violent wind currents, which could cause the dirigible to keep moving, even when tied up to the mast. Overall, the nature of weather was the huge obstacle, proving to be a difficult hurdle in the Empire State Building's initial airship mooring concept.
401	15234	6	3	"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced when they were attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle was the safety of the people. The author states, ""Most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" This would have been a major problem, as any fire could have been catastrophic. Another obstacle was the violent air currents that made it hard to land. In this essay it says, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This quote shows why landing would be dangerous, as passengers would have difficulty disembarking safely. Finally, it was illegal to fly airships too low over urban areas. The text explains, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building, or even approach the area."" This shows how even if everything worked, they wouldn't be able to do it because of legal restrictions. These are just three of the obstacles that prevented the builders of the Empire State Building from docking dirigibles, ultimately rendering the ambitious plan impractical and unfeasible."
402	15235	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The Empire State Building is located in the densely populated New York City, posing a significant risk. Therefore, if the dirigible dangled high in the air above those people, it would surely be unsafe, especially considering potential equipment malfunctions. In addition to the safety aspect, one of the greatest obstacles was nature. The violent winds on top of the building are always shifting due to the air currents, therefore, it would cause the dirigibles to swivel around the mast, making docking incredibly difficult. Lastly, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, thus making it illegal for dirigibles to ever fly up to the building, regardless of any engineering solutions. Ultimately, these challenges proved insurmountable, and the dirigible docking idea was abandoned.
403	15236	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacles while trying to build the mast. One problem was that there was a lot of pressure and stress that would be put on the building if a dirigible was to dock there. This was because of the high wind speeds and of the sheer size of the dirigible. The designers had to make over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to the building's framework to account for the pressure that would be exerted. Another obstacle was that there is a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This meant that the dirigibles would not be allowed to even get close to the building, let alone dock on it safely. Eventually, these obstacles and other safety issues, such as the use of hydrogen inside the dirigibles and the highly flammable nature of the blimp itself, caused the dirigible docking idea to disappear entirely.
404	15237	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in order to try to dock dirgibles there. One of the challenges they faced was how to make sure the building wouldn't collapse if the docked a 800 foot dirgigible on the top. They had to make about 2 million dollars worth of changes to the building's frame to be able to support a dirigible. Another obstacle they faced was how to dock dirigible at the top of the building without endangering the densiley populated area of down town New York. ""Most dirgibles outside of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"". The builder faced many obstacles by trying to beable to support a dirigible but was impossible from the start."
405	15238	6	3	Obstacles the builders had to try and overcome were the extra pressure on the frame of the CAPS1 module and the difficult docking process. Also, the high-speed winds made construction basically impossible.
406	15239	6	3	Based on The Mooring Mast article, by @PERSON1, the builders of the Empire State Building face numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Their dream put New York on the forefront of modern travel never was fulfilled. First, over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework because of the stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure, which would add stress to the frame. However, one of the greatest obstacles the builders encountered was safety. Most dirigibles use hydrogen, which is highly flammable and could be very dangerous, especially in highly populated areas such as New York. Also, the violent winds on top of the building made it impossible to keep the dirigibles stable and not swiveling around the mast. Lead weights could be used to weigh down dirigibles that moored in the field, but this would be unsafe dangling from a building. Finally the idea violated a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. All of the contributing obstacles the builders faced made their dream of using the mooring mast for dirigibles unsuccessful.
407	15240	6	3	Some of the troubles builders came into play with while constructing the Empire State Building's mooring mast, were structure, how it would be built, and how it could physically hold a blimp without being ripped out. One problem was figuring out how to reinforce the mast so that the load could transfer to the foundation instead of ripping off the top half of the building, requiring innovative engineering solutions to ensure stability. Ultimately, these challenges demanded creative solutions to ensure structural integrity and prevent catastrophic failure.
408	15241	6	3	"The concept of a docking mast for the Empire State Building met with failure because of a variety of reasons. One of the major problems was that it was directly over the downtown area of New York City which is very densely populated. After the Hindenburg fire in New Jersey, ""the owners... realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place over a densely populated area."" The second major obstacle was controlling a dirigible in the often violent winds at the top of the tower, making docking extremely precarious. It was the practice at the time to control the back of the dirigible with lead weights but over a civilian area this was ""neither practical nor safe."" Another important reason why the builders faced obstacles was the already existing law that prohibited low-flying aircraft over cities. Despite the two dirigibles that approached the mooring mast, neither managed to allow passengers to disembark, highlighting the impracticality of the design, and the idea was ""quietly dropped"" as it should have been. There were too many obstacles for it to succeed, ultimately demonstrating that the concept was inherently flawed from a safety and logistical perspective."
409	15242	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building attempted to create a mast where dirigibles could dock. At first I thought it was a great idea, then realized there were obstacles. First obstacle discovered was ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium"" (L¸sted). This was an issue because hydrogen is very flammable and if it were to catch on fire in New York, thousands of people would be hurt/killed. The greatest obstacle was the wind. The amount of wind changed constantly and even if the dirigible was attached properly, the back would continue to move around, which would lead to danger on the streets. The dirigible would be dangling over the pedastrians (L¸sted). One other reason was a legal reason. It was illegal to fly a dirigible too low over urban areas, therefore the dirigible was not allowed to get low enough to land on the building. Two tried and neither of them were successful. The constructors of the mooring mast were oblivious to these issues at the beginning, than realized them after. The Empire State Building could not be used to land dirigible due to the fact that non-U.S dirigibles used Hydrogen, the current of the wind changes frequently, and it was illegal to fly the dirigible low enough to attach, thus rendering the ambitious docking plan ultimately unfeasible."
410	15243	6	3	The architects of the mooring mast faced many problems when building the mast itself. One of the problems was that most dirigibles outside of the country use hydrogen, which was highly flammable, rather than helium to make the blimps buoyant. If one of those blimps ever caught fire like the German dirigible, the Hindenburg, in New Jersey, then it would put many citizens in jeopardy. This densely populated area would be much more hazardous than a rural area in New Jersey. The last problem they faced was the law that prohibited airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. Since no foreign dirigible could dock and refuel there because of the type of gas keeping it afloat, while no domestic dirigible could dock and refuel because of the law prohibiting it, the idea of a mooring mast quickly diminished from the citizens' imaginations, and they looked to modern transportation such as airplanes, which seemed a much more practical and safe alternative.
411	15244	6	3	"Besides the facts that docking dirigibles on a mooring mast on the Empire State Building would cost over $2 million and add a lot of stress to the building's frame, Smith wanted to pursue his dream. Unfortunately, he couldn't do that. There are three big reasons. In paragraph two it says most dirigibles are too flammable. That's because they use hydrogen rather than helium, just like the German dirigible Hindenburg, which was destroyed in a fire in New Jersey. Paragraph two also says docking the dirigibles is plain dangerous because the wind would cause them to sway all over, rather than being docked on the ground and being weighed down. Lastly, it wasn't legal. Paragraph four states ""...an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas was another practical reason."" The dirigibles would not be high enough in the air to be legal, and it was highly dangerous because of pedestrians below. Thus, Smith's dream faced insurmountable obstacles."
412	15245	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles as an attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph @NUM1 it shows an obstacle the builders faced. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" This is because of the wind. The wind would shift due to violent air currents, making docking a dangerous proposition and ultimately impractical."
413	15246	6	3	In the Mooring Mast, by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on it. To dock, a moor mast was necessary. One could not simply place one on the Empire State Building because it would add stress to the building's frame. Also, the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would add stress, which would force more modifications to the frame costing upwards of sixty thousand dollars, a significant sum at the time. The mooring mast was not completed mainly because of safety concerns. After the combustion of the Hindenburg, owners of the Empire State Building realized the magnitude of disaster it would cause if a similar incident happened in New York City. Nature was also an obstacle, with constantly changing violent air currents threatening to move the dirigible, which could not be anchored down as it could be in a field. It was a risk not worth taking given the potential for catastrophe. Lastly, a law passed earlier prevented dirigibles from even approaching buildings on such an elevation over urban areas, effectively making the entire endeavor illegal. These were the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the ambitious plan.
414	15247	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. When it says in the passage, ""could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof,"" this means that the architects would have to modify and strengthen the building for a ""thousand-foot dirigible"" to land there. Over a million dollars worth of changes had to be made for this. Safety was another problem. Dirigibles from other countries used hydrogen instead of helium. Because hydrogen is highly flammable, downtown New York could have been destroyed by a large fire if a dirigible caught fire there. Nature itself was also a problem. ""Winds on top of the building were constantly shifting."" This would cause the dirigible to swivel around, which would be dangerous. The architects came in contact with many problems, ultimately making the prospect of dirigible docking an impractical and hazardous endeavor."
415	15248	6	3	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was that if they dropped the mooring mast on the top of the building they would have strengthened the frame because of the wind pressure, and pressure from the single cable. Also most dirigibles from out of state were highly flammable because they used hydrogen rather than helium, posing a significant fire risk. Another problem was that New York is a highly populated city and they did not want to take the risk of having something fall from the top of the building onto citizens down below. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature; the violent winds were constantly shifting due to the violent currents. Even if they could get the dirigibles tied down the back would be flying around, making docking exceptionally difficult. They also suggested using lead weights to hold it down, but if they fell the pedestrians on the street would be in great danger. The last obstacle faced was the fact that there was a law about airships flying too low over urban areas, further complicating the practicality of the endeavor, and ultimately making it unfeasible.
416	15249	6	3	When the builders of the Empire State Building took on the difficult task of building a mooring mast at the top of the structure for dirigibles to dock at, they faced various obstacles that made it difficult for them to carry out their plan. One of the first obstacles they were faced with was the fact that they couldn't just slap a long mooring mast on the building's flat roof. The huge dirigible that would be held by one cable tether would add an immense amount of stress to the building's frame and foundation. The builders responded by constructing an even stronger frame for the building. The main problem the builders faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the structure were the safety issues. Dirigibles (aside from the US Navy airships) mostly used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is extremely flammable and increases the risk of fire. Since the blimps would be above thousands of pedestrians of the city, the risk of a blimp catching fire was much too high. On top of that, the winds at the top of the Empire State Building were always shifting due to the violent air currents, causing the blimp to swivel around the mooring mast. Although Al Smith had a great vision for docking blimps at the top of his building, the reality was that it was unrealistic, and the builders were faced with too many obstacles for it to work. Ultimately, the challenges proved insurmountable, rendering the ambitious plan impractical.
417	15250	6	3	"While builders attempted to create a landing area for dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, they ran into many problems. Al's idea sounded unrealistic, but with enough motivation, they were set on trying to make it happen. After so much renovation, work, and ideas, they finally realized all the potential problems as what was being built became apparent. The main reason they never used the dock is because they realized it could possibly catch fire, like it had in New Jersey. ""The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area..."" Also, they warned about the intense winds on top of the tower. They feared it would continuously blow around the dirigible without a way to weigh it down. Another reason is it is against the law to fly airships too low over urban areas. The builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, ultimately making the ambitious project unfeasible and unsafe."
418	15251	6	3	The obstacles the builders faced were very dangerous and unsafe. They were the difference between them failing or succeeding. One of the problems was violent air currents. The passage said that winds towards the top of the building were always shifting and they easily could have been able to swivel the dirigible. If this happened, then they never would have been able to land on the mooring mast. The next obstacle they faced was hovering over pedestrians. It just wasn't an option after the safety of the pedestrians was in danger and the risk of dropping equipment was too high. It was also a law that airships weren't allowed to fly that low over urban areas. So it made it illegal for them to tie up to the building or even come close to the area. It was just too dangerous to attempt the mooring process under those conditions.
419	15252	6	3	"Many of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were issues that should have been thought about before construction began. At such a height their whirlwind issues that could push the derigible in undesired directions. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air current."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). After the Hindenburg exploded the concerns for the same thing happening was a large safety concern. ""The owners of the Empire State building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2 Line 6) These significant safety and logistical problems ultimately rendered the docking station concept impractical and demonstrated a lack of foresight in the initial planning stages."
420	15253	6	3	"There were several obstacles that prevented dirigibles from docking at the Empire State Building. First, if a dirigible was ""moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" The framework was not strong enough for this additional weight and force. But the main reason was safety. It was known that most foreign dirigibles used ""hydrogen rather than helium"", which is highly flammable and posed a significant fire risk. Things wouldn't go well if there was an incident in a populated place like New York, with the potential for catastrophic consequences. Also, the winds causing the ship to swivel around made the situation more unpredictable, and lead couldn't be used to weigh it down for safety reasons. Finally, there was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" which makes it illegal for any dirigible to even come close to a building. All of these reasons contributed to why docking dirigibles would come with many obstacles, ultimately making the ambitious plan impractical."
421	15254	6	3	Most dirigibles from outside of U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New jersey, On May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. The disaster highlighted the potential dangers of hydrogen-filled airships, leading to increased safety concerns.
422	15255	6	3	"From the story the Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders faced huge problems when they tried to make it accessible for dirigibles to land. One major factor was the winds at such high altitude, ""The winds on top of building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This made securing the massive airships a daunting task. The builders not only had to think of a way for the ships to be secure and not blow around, but also needed a way to support the weight of the dirigible because of the already heavy building. This added significant structural challenges. These are only some of the great problems the builders needed to deal with to make the mooring mast a reality."
423	15256	6	3	"After reading the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, it's easy to see that this project faces numerous obstacles to overcome. The builders of the Empire State Building have a lot on their plate in order to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, the builders have to modify and strengthen the @ORGANIZATION1 frame and also construct a mast to which dirigibles could dock. If there was to be ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether,... (@NUM1) it would add an enormous amount of stress to the entire building. This is why the steel frame of the Empire State Building has to be strengthened, and ""Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"" (@NUM1). The builders of the Empire State Building also have to construct a mast for the dirigibles; this mast, designed to accommodate these massive airships, posed a significant engineering challenge. In the end, ""...the architects who designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from the inside, with a step-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself"" (@NUM3). This idea of adding a mast for dirigibles to the Empire State Building creates much work for the builders. This excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2 easily illustrates the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building have to overcome. From modifying the frame to constructing the mast, these builders sure do have a greatly increased workload, making the project a complex and demanding endeavor."
424	15257	6	3	"Many things went wrong while trying to allow dirigibles to dock ontop of the Empire State Building. First, allowing this dirigible to dock on top of the Empire State Building ""would add stress to the buildings frame"". -@CAPS1 @NUM1. These Dirigibles are highly flamable and over a very populated place like New York City could be very dangerous, particularly considering the potential for accidents or sabotage. The winds at the top of the building were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast.""-@CAPS2 @NUM2. This made docking incredibly difficult and unsafe. If lead weights were used they could fall from dirigible and kill civilians on the streets below, posing an unacceptable risk. The biggest obstacle was that a law against airships flying too low over urban areas was already in place. This entire concept seemed to be a good idea on paper, fueled by futuristic optimism, but when actually attempted it was too unrealistic and fraught with peril to ever become a viable transportation method."
425	15258	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. To solve this problem, Al Smith built a mooring mast atop the skyscraper. This would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours to refuel and discharge passengers.
426	15259	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced various obstacles and challenges in allowing dirigibles to dock there, including how to attach the mast and how to move people between the dirigible and the building. In order to attach the mast where the dirigibles would land, the builders could not simply fasten it with the cable tether to the top of the building. This would ""add stress to the building's frame"" with the combined pressure of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure. Therefore, the builders had to get the pressure down into the ground by strengthening and altering the building's steel frame, a considerable undertaking that added to the project's complexity. Another obstacle the builders faced was the challenge of transporting people and luggage from the building to a dirigible floating in the air. The dirigibles would only be tethered by their front ends, but the gondola, where the passengers rode, was located underneath the dirigible. This meant the construction of ""a gangplank to an open observation platform"" from which the people and luggage had to be moved from the 102nd floor by a special elevator. Although the builders of the Empire State Building faced various obstacles in building the mast, the one they really should have considered was the danger and impracticality of docking dirigibles 102 stories over New York City. Ultimately, these logistical and safety concerns proved insurmountable, and the dirigible docking plan was abandoned, highlighting the importance of practicality in ambitious architectural endeavors."
427	15260	6	3	There are many problems the dirigibles had with docking. One problem was a lack of suitable landing space, especially near major cities. There was also the problem of winds. The wind would cause a major problem for if they could dock. The wind could cause it to spin around the building causing injuries to people or the dirigible. If it's swung around and hit the building it could cause structural damage to the mooring mast or the airship itself. The dirigible could also explode into flames if a spark is caused from it hitting the building, especially given the flammable nature of the hydrogen gas often used for lift. It could end up like the Hindenburg, highlighting the dangers of such volatile conditions during docking. These factors made docking a risky maneuver overall.
428	15261	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. By building a mooring mast, they had to make changes to the existing plans for the building's skeleton. ""The steel frame of the building had been modified and strengthened"" in order for the mast to fit properly and remain stable and safe. This strengthening was crucial to handle the immense forces a docked airship could exert, especially in windy conditions. Another obstacle faced by the builders was creating a design that would allow dirigibles to dock on the mast. They were to tie the front of the aircraft to the building, however this didn't work out, because, as the author states, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This made passenger transfer and cargo handling impractical and dangerous. All in all, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempt to let dirigibles dock there."
429	15262	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles (Blimps) to dock there was that there were way too many risks that were being taken to make this mast, and it was just too dangerous. I think that the mast posed too many risks because, for one, a dirigible would be flying too low, and two, if it caught on fire or was hit by lightning, it would explode and people would get seriously hurt, OR the mast could snap off! As @PERSON1 said, ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring air ships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear."" @CAPS1 @PERSON1 Clavan means that the fact that there are so many problems with mooring air ships to this ""mast"" that it just isn't safe to go through with right now! This ultimately led to the abandonment of the dirigible docking idea, as the safety concerns proved insurmountable."
430	15263	6	3	Al Smith faced some obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles dock on the mast on top of the Empire State building. The first problem him and the architects faced was they couldn't just put the mast on top of the building's flat roof because it would add stress to the building's frame. The dirigible's load and the wind would also add stress to the structural integrity. Another reason was safety, as most dirigibles used hydrogen, which was highly flammable, posing a significant risk in the event of a leak or accident. Also, the winds at the top of the building had violent currents, causing instability. These winds were always shifting, which would cause the back of the ship to move unexpectedly. Lastly, dirigibles couldn't fly near the building because there was a law against aircraft flying too low over urban areas, rendering the plan to tie dirigibles to the mast impractical and ultimately illegal.
431	15264	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. First, the expectations of the project were unrealistic because there ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" meaning even if they found a safe way to land dirigibles they would be breaking the law. Second, there were ""violent air currents"" around the building's peak. When they tried to dock a dirigible on the building, it could not get close enough to it to land because of the unpredictable wind conditions at such a height. Lastly, it was a huge safety hazard. Most dirigibles ""used hydrogen rather than helium,"" and hydrogen is very flammable. In a densely populated area, ""the owners of the Empire State Building realized how [bad an] accident could have been, considering the potential for a catastrophic fire. As a result, dirigibles never fulfilled the expectations of the transportation of the future and they did not dock on the Empire State Building, primarily due to these insurmountable safety and logistical concerns."
432	15265	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, because they had to come up with a way for a mooring mast to land on the Building's roof, because a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable can add stress to the building's frame. The Building's frame would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the situation. That wasn't the only obstacle; money was one of the problems as well, ""Over sixty thousand dollar's worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework."" That's a lot of money that is being used just for a frame of a building. Safety was an obstacle as well, ""The greatest reason was one of safety. Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" I think safety was the greatest obstacle they had, because what if a hydrogen dirigible were to blow up on top of the Empire Building? Think of all the people that could get hurt because they don't call New York the city that never sleeps because people stay up at night in their house. They call it the city that never sleeps because it's always moving, there's always people on the streets, and downtown New York is always full of people, making the potential for casualties from a disaster significantly higher. Ultimately, these financial and safety concerns proved too significant, contributing to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan."
433	15266	6	3	"When building the Empire State Building, the builders had to overcome many obsticles. One obsticle, for example, was a lack of suitable landing area. The dirigibles were very large, some spanding @NUM1 feet, therefore in a city of buildings, there were not many suitable areas to land. Another obsticle they had overcome was the fact that the city did not allow the dirigibles to be that close to rural areas. Although these reasons are plenty enough, the article mentions that perhaps the greatest obsticle was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (pg. @NUM2-paragraph @NUM3). Because of this, it would have been hard for the dirigibles to land safely. All in all, the idea to land dirigibles in this place was too unrealistic."
434	15267	6	3	The plan to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building encountered problems from its introduction until its conclusion. The first problem was the original design of the building. The original design did not include a dirigible docking station. When plans for the station were introduced, the building was not strong enough to carry the heavy load of a spire and a dirigible. To adjust, an additional @MONEY1 millions were spent in order to ensure the building would be structurally sound during a dirigible docking. The next problem became imminent after the Hindenburg's fire: any hydrogen-filled dirigible that caught fire at the Empire State Building which cause significant damage. Moreover, because many dirigibles used hydrogen, the safety risk was significant. Wind proved to be another obstacle. The force of a dirigible being blown around by heavy winds could prove to be too much for the structure of the building. Moreover, because any dirigible docking at the building would be one thousand feet off the ground, there was no way to anchor the dirigibles. The fact that many tall spires lined the @LOCATION1 New York City skyline presented an imminent danger to any dirigible trying to dock. Finally, one of the most significant problems of building a dirigible docking station was the fact that law prohibited low flying aircraft in urban areas, ultimately rendering the entire concept impractical and unsafe.
435	15268	6	3	The problems that the Building had to face meant the difficulty of solving the problem of mooring airships to fixed masts at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the installation of the landing gear, focusing on more immediate structural concerns. Thus, the installation was delayed.
436	15269	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles, including attempting to make a dock for dirigibles atop the structure. The architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower, requiring innovative construction techniques. They would have to ensure the Empire State Building was strong enough to withstand the powerful wind blowing around up on top at such a height. In the late run, they would have to face the law and regulations regarding building codes and safety. These factors combined to create a complex set of challenges that the builders successfully overcame.
437	15270	6	3	"Obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced included the impracticality of their planned dirigible mooring mast. They had planned for dirigibles to tie to the mast, but the height of the building was so high that dirigibles would not be able to keep steady while unloading. For example, in paragraph one, it says ""the Goodyear blimp Columbia attempted a publicity stunt where it would tie up and deliver a bundle of newspapers."" Because the complete dirigible mooring equipment had never been installed, a worker atop the mooring mast would have to catch the bundle of newspapers on a rope dangling from the blimp. Other obstacles were that dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen was very flammable, making the mooring idea even more dangerous. Ultimately, the dirigible mooring plan proved to be unfeasible due to a combination of logistical challenges and safety concerns."
438	15271	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were two practical obstacles. Nature itself posed the first problem. Even if the dirigible was tethered up to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast due to wind conditions, making passenger transfer dangerous. Another thing was that it was illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas due to safety concerns. Although two dirigibles attempted docking but failed, by the late 1930s, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers had quietly disappeared, rendered impractical by weather and regulations.
439	15272	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem was the stress on the building's frame, and the building required over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to fix this initial structural issue. Also, the back end of the dirigible would swing freely in the strong wind; this is usually fixed by attaching a lead weight to the back in the fields where they usually land, but dangling that over a city is very dangerous. Another problem is the law stating no aircraft flying too low over urban areas, presenting a legal challenge. Finally, dirigibles never caught on as a popular mode of transportation. So, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their attempt to make a dirigible docking station, ultimately leading to its abandonment.
440	15273	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First of all, the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. To prevent this, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Secondly, most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The owners realized that if one of the hydrogen dirigibles were to catch fire just like the Hindenburg did in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the accident could be much worse if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. The greatest obstacle that the builders were faced with was violent air currents while the dirigible was tethered. The back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast due to winds, and using lead weights to weight the back down, where they would be dangling above pedestrians, would neither be practical nor safe. The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed, demonstrating a lack of foresight in the initial design.
441	15274	6	3	"By attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. One of the obstacles that they faced was the re-designing of the building. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"" that meant that they had to make modifications (over @MONEY1 worth) to reinforce the structure. Another obstacle that they faced was that most of the dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, posing a fire hazard. Hydrogen is highly flammable, increasing the risk of accidents during docking. And the greatest obstacle that the builders had was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Even if the Dirigible got parked, the winds would shake its tail too much and that wasnt safe, ultimately rendering the docking platform impractical and dangerous."
442	15275	6	3	Based on this excerpt, the architects had to go through a lot of obstacles in order to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. First, they had to redesign the building's frameworks because the weight of the dirigible would add stress to it. Then, they added two more floors to the top of the building to serve as the boarding area for the passengers. Two months after they finally reframed the building, they proudly put the American flag at the top of the mooring mast. Soon after all this effort, they realized proceeding with these designs were foolish because it was unsafe and not practical, marking all their prior efforts as essentially futile. Those are the obstacles that the architects had to go through in order to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building.
443	15276	6	3	"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced. One of the obstacles faced was when trying to dock on top of the building. Since it was so tall, there were very harsh winds that the dirigibles could be controlled. When the Los Angeles tried to dock there, it couldn't, because ""[it] could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" Also, ""the pilot could not even take his hands off the control levers"" because the dirigible might bump into other buildings if he did. Another obstacle they faced was that New York was densely populated and the mooring mast was surrounded by other buildings. If it caught on fire like the Hindenburg it could be a huge problem. ""... how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area."" The third huge obstacle they faced was that there was an actual law against anything flying that low in cities. There was, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This meant that the dirigibles couldn't even get close enough to tie up since they weren't allowed to fly down to it. Since there were so many apparent obstacles and flaws in the plan, the builders should've caught it before and never built the mooring mast above the Empire State Building. The impracticality and danger of the mooring mast should have been evident, making its construction an avoidable mistake."
444	15277	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast,"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders faced many problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One main problem was that, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This could be a serious problem if the dirigible burst into flames and fire rained down on, ""a densely populated area such as downtown New York,"" potentially causing catastrophic damage and loss of life. Another obstacle to the creation of the mooring mast was the wind, which, ""were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The dirigibles would have to be, ""weighted down with lead weights... where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street."" This would be, ""neither practical nor safe,"" because the weights could fall and kill people, creating an unacceptable risk to those below. The final obstacle for building a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" Ultimately, the builders of the mooring mast faced many problems, ""that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed,"" highlighting a significant oversight in the initial planning stages of the project."
445	15278	6	3	The builders faced many obstacles in trying to allow dirigibles to dock on it. One problem is the docking a dirigible to the roof would add too much stress on the frame, potentially compromising the building's structural integrity. Another is having all the flammable gases above a highly populated area, posing a significant safety risk to the city below. Also there was already a law that prohibited dirigibles from flying low over urban areas, directly conflicting with the rooftop docking plan. Lastly the wind constantly changing direction would make the ship too unstable, making docking maneuvers extremely hazardous and unreliable, ultimately rendering the entire concept impractical.
446	15279	6	3	In the excerpt there were obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock their. Al Smith saw an opportunity by adding a mooring mast to the top of the building allowing dirigibles to ancher there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers on and off. The high winds at that altitude presented a safety challenge. With this idea the architects and engineers of the Empire State Building had to consult with experts, by taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations at the U.S. Naval Air Station in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The architects also met with the president of a recently formed airship transport company that planned to offer dirigible service across the pacific Ocean. Now as you can see the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there, but they creatively sought solutions to address these challenges.
447	15280	6	3	"The ambition of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was a lot of work. They had to spend a whole lot of money and it wasn't a easy job. They spended over sixty thousand dollars on just modifications. I know this because in paragraph @NUM1 it said ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building frame work. @CAPS2 you can see they spended a lot of money on the mooring mast; this was a significant expense. Also it wasn't a easy job to make everything work there was a lot of things they had to worrie about like safety issues, and ensuring structural integrity. I know it wasn't a easy job because in paragraph @NUM1 it also said ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State buildings flat roof."" @CAPS2 you can see they struggled to make the mooring mast accomplish.Therefore, the attempt to accommodate dirigibles was both costly and challenging."
448	15281	6	3	While attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building the workers faced many obstacles. One of the obstacles was safety. While the dirigible, or zeppelin, was docked its body would sway in the breeze. This lead to a question of safety for the passengers getting on and off, especially concerning the gangplank. Also there was no safe way to weigh the dirigible down, like when the dirigible lands in a field. Any weights used would be hanging over pedestrians on the busy New York City streets. Another obstacle was the law prohibiting airships flying low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for dirigibles to dock or even approach the area near the building. The main obstacle was nature itself. There are very violent winds at the top of the Empire State Building which would cause the dirigible to sway dangerously. Docking at the Empire State Building was too complicated and dangerous for the idea to be completed and therefore was abandoned.
449	15282	6	3	"In some cases builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles such as safety. As stated in the reading, ""The greatest reason was one of safety: dirigibles outside @LOCATION1 used hydrogen, which is highly flammable."" If a dirigible was to catch fire on top of that building it could do a lot of damage. The next reason is there are ""laws against airships flying too low over urban areas."" The Empire State building was built in the middle of downtown, if something was to go wrong the dirigibles could harm a lot of people. Another reason is because of nature. The author stated, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This put the dirigibles at risk of hitting that building or another. The last reason is because ""the complete dirigible mooring equipment had never been installed."" If the law and safety hadn't been a problem there would be no way to land a dirigible because they didn't have the things needed to land it. All of these obstacles highlight that the initial vision for dirigible landings on the Empire State Building was ultimately impractical due to a combination of safety concerns, legal restrictions, environmental factors, and incomplete infrastructure."
450	15283	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building @ORGANIZATION1 faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were the weather and the Building Frame. The weather obstacle @CAPS1 was the wind because the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The wind was an obstacle because if a big gust of wind came, it could knock building materials or even workers off the building. A second obstacle was the building Frame because the dirigible was so big that, at the top of the building being held by a single cable, that would add stress to the frame and would make the building unsteady. These are two examples of the obstacles the builders working on the Empire State Building @ORGANIZATION1 faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, ultimately rendering the ambitious docking plan impractical.
451	15284	6	3	The mooring mast was a failure from the start. The builders and architects were not looking at the problems that would be present but only at how to build the most. The first main problem the building workers faced when attempting to allow these dirigible's to land was actually building a mast atop the highest building in the world. Then came the necessary modifications needed to improve upon the buildings framework to support the zepplins weight, putting stress on the building after being pushed around by winds 1, 250 ft above the ground. Such intense pressures on the building's structure posed significant engineering challenges. Perhaps the most important aspect of bringing these large zepplins over heavily crowded areas was safety. The aspect of safety for pedestrians below would have been almost non-existent had the idea been carried out. For example, some of those zepplins use hydrogen to stay a loft, and if a hydrogen filled blimp combusted over a city, it would seem pretty immenent people below would be harmed, creating a potentially catastrophic scenario. This project seems to present far too many obstables for these architects to overcome for docking a single blimp, ultimately rendering the entire concept impractical and dangerous.
452	15285	6	3	"The Mooring Mast, by @ORGANIZATION2 describes the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The Empire State Building was competing with the Chrysler Building in being the tallest building. Al Smith, the governor at that time, didn't want to be beat. Being the governor of New York, Smith added more floors to the building developing it into a dirigible dock. As time went on, the building ran into more problems. Tying a thousand-foot dirigible to the building, would add stress to the frame. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" The frame around the building wasn't durable enough to hold a ""blimp,"" risking collapse and damage to surrounding structures. Sixty-thousand dollars went into re-enforcing the frame, but in the end, the building still failed to meet the necessary standards. After the frame was stable enough, more problems occurred. ""The greatest reason was one of safety. Dirigibles used hydrogen, meaning it flammable."" Not only did the reason of safety of people go against the building, so did the law: ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" Once Al Smith realized even the law forbade this, all plans that rose into action stopped, and the Empire State Building remained the same, ultimately proving the impracticality and danger of such an endeavor."
453	15286	6	3	"When the Empire State Building was created it was supposed to be a ""pit stop"" for dirigibles, known today as blimps. It was meant to be the modern way of travel, but many problems surfaced changing the plans. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, which was a major safety hazard! Another problem presented itself: a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. If anything were to go wrong with the ship many people would be put in danger. Harsh wind would provide the risk of puncturing the blimp against buildings; also endangering the people below it. Ultimately, the impracticality and danger led to the abandonment of the dirigible docking station concept."
454	15287	6	3	"The obstacles builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building were safety, nature, and U.S. law. Safety was a major obstacle because, ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1 line @NUM2), posing a significant risk to the building and the city. Nature itself was another obstacle faced in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@CAPS1 @NUM3 line @NUM4), making docking a precarious and challenging maneuver. One final obstacle that would halt the docking of dirigibles at the Empire State Building was U.S. law. ""The law was against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (@CAPS1 @NUM5 line @NUM6), effectively preventing the fulfillment of the original vision. Therefore, safety concerns, unpredictable weather conditions, and legal restrictions ultimately made the dirigible docking plan for the Empire State Building unfeasible."
455	15288	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The mooring mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the airships faced many obstacles. One of the obstacles was that the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast, making it difficult to maintain a stable connection. Another obstacle was that the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, further complicating the docking procedure. These were some of the obstacles the airships faced during the challenging process of mooring to the mast."
456	15289	6	3	"The builders of the Empire States Building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Paragraph fourteen said, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" In planning for the mast, builders did not account for the high winds. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" making docking incredibly hazardous. The greatest reason the mooring mast of the Empire State Building never fulfilled its purpose was because of safety issues. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable,"" posing a significant risk. On May 6, 1937, the German Zeppelin, Hindenburg, was destroyed by a fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, further highlighting the dangers of hydrogen. Owners of the Empire State Building than recognized that if the same incident was to take place in New York, more lives would be lost due to the building's location. Builders of the Empire State Building failed to recognize the dangers of the mooring mast, ultimately leading to its disuse."
457	15290	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a couple of obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles the builders had was with the stress of the dirigibles' load, as said in the excerpt in paragraph @NUM1, which presented significant engineering challenges. Another obstacle they had with landing the dirigibles to dock was that they had to modify and strengthen the steel frame of the Empire State Building to handle the immense weight and potential strain. They needed to do that so it could accommodate this new situation, which is to get dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, thus showing the complexity of the project.
458	15291	6	3	"In the excerpt of ""The Mooring Mast"" the people attempting to make dirigible docks had ended up with big obstacles in reaching that goal. Before even adding the mooring mast on top of the Empire State building, the workers had to modify the frame or otherwise ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" The mooring mast goal was really starting to be doubtful when one problem wasn't realized: safety. Most of the dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen instead of helium, for example ""a German dirigible named Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey,"" since hydrogen is very flammable. Because of realizing this, the situation could've been ""how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Also ""nature itself"" was the greatest obstacle, as shifting winds would cause the dirigible to swivel around, even if it makes it to the mooring mast. The dirigibles could use weights to stabilize them, but using them at the Empire State building, ""while they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the Street, was neither practical nor Safe."" The combination of structural concerns, the extreme flammability risk of hydrogen, and the unpredictable nature of the wind ultimately made the mooring mast concept an unfeasible ambition."
459	15292	6	3	The obstacles the company faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock is that they needed a strong enough cable so it could hold the blimp, the passengers, and any additional weight. Another obstacle was how could they manage that with the power of the wind that high up in the air. Another reason is if something went wrong, there would be pedestrians at the base. Another reason is the building structure would have to hold up. Therefore, many factors needed consideration to ensure the safety and feasibility of dirigible docking.
460	15293	6	3	"In the story The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. One of the obstacles faced was that putting a thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building would add stress to the building's frame. The enormous weight and wind resistance made the builders have to modify the frame, reinforcing the structure to withstand the additional strain. Another obstacle the builders faced was safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is flamable."" This would put great danger to the people of New York, given the height and density of the city. That was a huge problem the builders faced. The builders at the Empire state Building faced many obstacles but safety and reconstruction were just some of those problems that ultimately contributed to the abandonment of the mooring mast concept."
461	15294	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow the dirigibles to land there. The most prominent obstacle was that posed by nature, which was that there was always a constant change in wind direction, so the dirigibles would not be able to land safely. The architects thought that heavy weights could be put onto the ends of the blimps, but they then realized that that would not be safe for pedestrians walking below. Also, the building had to be a certain number of feet high, in order for the airship height rule to be eliminated. If it was not and something exploded, the heavily populated city of New York would be in grave danger. In theory, the mast for dirigibles was a revolutionary idea, but in reality it just wouldn't work. Ultimately, the impracticality and inherent dangers outweighed any potential benefits.
462	15295	6	3	"There were many obstacles that builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles were that architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. This is because as it says on paragraph @NUM1, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" The added weight and potential for swaying would compromise the structural integrity. Another obstacle was making the mooring mast of the Empire State Building to fulfill its purpose. It was very hard to make the mooring mast fulfill its purpose because the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. In paragraph @NUM2 it states that, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These unpredictable conditions posed a significant challenge to safely docking such a large aircraft. These are the reasons why the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the building. Ultimately, the environmental conditions proved too difficult to overcome, rendering the dirigible docking plan impractical."
463	15296	6	3	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, it describes many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building had to face in order to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle they had to face was the constant change in nature and how it could affect the dirigibles. The dirigibles would ""swivel around"" because the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This could put pedestrians on the street in danger because the ship is on top moving and could be unstable. Another obstacle is safety. Outside the United States the dirigibles ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" These foreign ships could ignite in the United States and put people in danger. Also the fact that the loading dock was more than 1,250 feet high and loading off could be unstable because of the winds. The last obstacle faced was the ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". Therefore it was illegal to get the dirigibles close enough to the buildings safely. All these obstacles faced made the workers and planners realize this idea could not be achieved without harming anyone or putting people in danger. The planners ultimately recognized the impracticality and inherent risks associated with mooring dirigibles to such a tall building in a busy urban environment."
464	15297	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building obstacles can be described in the following ways. First of all, the main obstacle was the nature of the mast. They described it as, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (paragraph @NUM1). Secondly, the dirigibles would dangle on top of the building, which wasn't safe for pedestrians. Lastly, there was a law for airships that couldn't fly too low or too high. These factors ultimately contributed to the failure of the dirigible docking plan."
465	15298	6	3	When the architects and builders were planning on how to build the mast onto the Empire State Building, they faced many obstacles. An example of an obstacle they faced was they had to construct the mast so it wouldn't fall off when a dirigible docked. They couldn't use cable tether to hold the mast down because it put too much stress on the building's frame and foundation. Another obstacle the builders had to face was how to strengthen the Empire State Building's frame. In order to get the Empire State Building's frame strong enough to hold the mast, it would cost over sixty thousand dollars, a significant sum at the time. Those are some examples of obstacles builders had to face as they worked to realize their ambitious design.
466	15299	6	3	In the building of @ORGANIZATION1 gets very competitive. He wants to construct the biggest building in New York City. When the construction was going on he wanted to add a top or hat so that the mast would be able to drop off people directly into the building. But then there was a problem, they had to consult it to allow it. Irving then let Al know that the building wasn't going to be done on time, because of the mast and its potential delays. That's what the Empire State building faced during its contraction, highlighting the challenges of ambitious construction projects.
467	15300	6	3	"Throughout the designing and construction stages of the Empire State building's mooring mast, builders and engineers confronted many issues including, the distribution of building stress, fire hazards and the constant shifting caused by winds. During the planning stages of engineers, they confronted an issue: how to alleviate stress on the Empire State Building's frame. According to engineers making the ""thousand foot dirigible moored at at the top of the building held by a single cable tether would add stress to the building's frame..."" the building would require ""over sixty thousand dollars"" in redesigning and modifying the current building's foundation and framework. Secondly, engineers and builders never considered the fire hazards, which they were confronted with after the completion of the mooring mast. The American dirigibles were filled with hydrogen rather than helium, making that gaseous-filled transportation highly flammable. An example of this safety violation occurred with the burning of a dirigible in Lakehurst, New Jersey, causing builders to reflect on the possible severity of this possible accident in the heavily populated area of New York. Thirdly, New York had ""violent air currents"" which could cause the rear of the dirigibles to swivel and shift. The only possible solution was to weigh down the back with lead blocks, but this would be ""neither practical nor safe."" Ultimately, the impracticality and dangers associated with mooring dirigibles led to the abandonment of the original vision. Engineers and builders of the Empire State Building were confronted with many problems and concerns sometimes only addressed by irrational solutions."
468	15301	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle they faced was that if a dirigible was moored by a single tether, ""the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" This presented immense structural challenges. Another obstacle was that most foreign dirigibles used hydrogen, which was highly flammable, and when the Hindenburg was destroyed, builders realized that accident would have been much worse if it had happened over a densely populated area like New York City, posing an unacceptable safety risk. A third obstacle was violent wind currents that would cause the back of the ship to swivel around, and the back of the dirigible couldn't be weighted down like in open landing fields because that would cause the weights to dangle dangerously above pedestrians on the street, endangering those below. These were major obstacles, and they are the reasons that the mast on top of the Empire State Building was never used to dock blimps, effectively ending the ambitious plan."
469	15302	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, the safety of the city and dirigibles were a concern. In paragraph thirteen, it states ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"". In addition, the greatest of obstacles was truly nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" As a dirigible attempted to succesfully use the mooring mast, the back end of the blimp would swivel around and around the mooring mast"". There additionally was a law which dated airships cannot fly that low over an urban area. Ultimately, these challenges, along with financial considerations, were far too difficult to surmount. Thus, the multiple obstacles which were faced through this ""architectural breakthrough"" destroyed any hope of the building's true purpose."
470	15303	6	3	"Constructing anything is always a difficult task, but trying to construct the world's tallest building and have dirigibles being able to dock there is even harder. The workers who were modifying the Empire State Building had numerous obstacles that stood in their way when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. The obstacle they could not control was nature herself. The winds were said to be ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" according to the excerpt which made it difficult for dirigibles to dock there, and dangerous, making precision landings near impossible. Also another factor that was an obstacle for the constructors was the building itself. The structure of the building would have to be modified because the dirigible ""would add stress to the building's frame,"" so constructors would have to make the building support this tremendous stress, potentially requiring significant reinforcements. Another obstacle was safety because some dirigibles were filled with hydrogen which was extremely flammable and dangerous for the massive population on the ground, raising concerns about potential explosions and disasters. These are a few of the many obstacles faced when modifying the Empire State Building, highlighting the immense challenges involved in such an ambitious and ultimately unrealized endeavor."
471	15304	6	3	The Empire State Building was and is one of the tallest buildings to ever be built. To make it the tallest building, architects designed the Mooring Mast. In building this mast, there were many obstacles to overcome, but even with those obstacles, it was still finished. The Mooring Mast was needed because without it the Empire State Building would not be the tallest in the world, surpassing the Chrysler Building. To make the Mooring Mast work, the builders had to overcome some obstacles. One of the main obstacles was to add on the Mast, they would have to attach steel from the Mast all the way down to the foundation, ensuring structural integrity. Another was after designing the Mast, they had to change the original plans for the building, incorporating it seamlessly. Ultimately, the successful completion of the Mooring Mast was integral to the Empire State Building achieving its record-breaking height.
472	15305	6	3	Builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow Dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. Between cost, saftey, and nature, there was no way this idea could ever work. Although the idea was good it was very impracticle. Saftey was a major problem with this idea. Most Dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium which is more flammable. If the Dirigibles ever broke out into flames over New York City it would burn the whole place down and kill thousands. Nature was another big problem. The winds on top of the Empire State Building were shifting all the time. The ship would swivel around the moorings mast. The Dirigibles usually moored in fields and used black lead weights to weigh them down. The weights dangling above peoples heads was very dangerous. Building the mooring mast was very dangerous and impracticle. It never happened due to saftey and now serves as a tea and soda area for use of sight seers. In conclusion, the attempt to moor dirigibles to the Empire State Building was simply too risky and ultimately unfeasible.
473	15306	6	3	On @DATE1, The Empire State Building was announced to reach the height of 1,250 feet. Al Smith, the architect of the building mentioned that the top would be more than ornamental. It was said that this amazing dream would come true for aviation pioneers. The building was going to have a mooring mast at its top for docking these new airships called dirigibles, otherwise known as blimps. This was thought out to be a great idea. Things didn't quite turn out as originally planned, and Fate struck. As fate struck, things should have been more apparent before it was ever constructed, as several factors contributed to the infeasibility. Most blimps from outside the states run on hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is more flammable, posing a significant safety risk. Winds on top of the building were constantly shifting, causing the dirigible to swivel, making docking extremely dangerous and unpredictable for both the airship and the building. It would be a disaster for anything to happen to New York City and the pedestrians it holds. Another law was the law of how close airships can be to the building, further complicating the docking procedure and increasing potential hazards. Thus, still leaving the Empire State Building at 1,250 feet, it stands as an iconic landmark, but it never fully realized its original ambitious goal of serving as a dirigible docking station due to a combination of safety concerns, logistical challenges, and regulatory restrictions.
474	15307	6	3	"The builders faced many obstacles when trying to build the Empire State Building. First of all, for it to be a 1250 ft building, it would have to have a very strong base to support it, and they had to reinforce the base to be able to mount the mooring mast on top. They also faced issues with the strong air currents that flowed above New York. None of the dirigibles were able to dock because of the high current. The mooring mast also placed stress on the frame; the builders had to factor in the potential weight and pull. ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" This proves how much difficulty the builders were going to have with the construction of the Empire State Building, as they had to overcome significant engineering challenges to ensure its stability and functionality."
475	15308	6	3	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in an attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. Dirigibles are enormous steel-framed balloons that can travel for long periods at a time of seventy miles per hour. Though dirigibles seemed great for attracting people by ways of traveling modernization, the builders faced a complex obstacle. There was no area of suitable landing for dirigibles. In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, many thorough changes in the building needed to be considered. The load being transported off the dirigible would add stress to the building frame, as would the wind pressure. To suit the building with accommodating the dirigible, the price for modifications to the building would cost @MONEY1. Many obstacles were scientifically proven as to why the dirigible could not dock at the Empire State Building. The issue of safety involving the hydrogen gasses being highly flammable was too much of a risk in the high populated area of New York. Also, nature was a large obstacle that was faced due to the wind at such a tall altitude. The law implying that airships couldn't fly too low was a practical reason why the dirigibles could not dock at the building. ""One set of engineers here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement and the Government people in Washington are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast,"" a quote by Al Smith demonstrates the challenges. The obstacles involving the moderate transportation idea were too impractical in using the mooring mast for dirigibles on the Empire State Building, ultimately rendering the project unfeasible."
476	15309	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their efforts to make it possible for dirigibles to dock on the mast. One problem was safety. Some dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, which is, according to the article, ""highly flammable."" If a dirigible caught fire right over a very populated area would be dangerous, potentially causing widespread damage and loss of life. Nature was another factor. ""Violent air currents"" made it difficult to maneuver a dirigible and bring it close enough to the mast to dock, adding a further layer of complexity to the already challenging task. Yet even if these frustrating conditions were not extant, it would still have been impossible for a dirigible to moor on the mast, because it was illegal. A law prohibited ""airships [from] flying too low over urban areas,"" which included dirigibles. These obstacles were overlooked in the plans to create the Empire State Building, rendering the dirigible mooring concept ultimately impractical."
477	15310	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, it focuses on the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Laws made it impossible for the original purpose of the mast, ""An existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."". Some dirigibles did try, but due to wind and safety reasons the idea was dropped. The impracticalities quickly became apparent. The safety of all human beings took part in the construction, ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire...the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area..."". Disaster was avoided by not proceeding further with the plan. When dealing with other countries you have to take into account that they may not use the safest things. Mother Nature can be a funny thing, ""The winds on top of the building were constely shifting..."". With the wind changing at a moment's notice it can be hard for a ship to land. Ultimately, the mooring mast plan proved unfeasible. When building something always be prepared for obstacles."
478	15311	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on it. The architects could not just drop a mooring mast on the top. If they did, the whole building's foundation would have to be changed since the structure wasn't designed to bear the immense weight and stress. Nature was also a major reason to stop the project. The wind currents were always changing and the blimp would swirl around, making docking a dangerous proposition. Safety was the greatest reason to shut down the job. Hydrogen is very flammable and if the blimp, which would be over New York was to burst into flames, many people would be killed. In conclusion, these obstacles are why the builders stopped and didn't complete the project for the Empire State Building.
479	15312	6	3	The Empire State Building faced numerous problems in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The most important reason was the safety of the people. Most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium to power their dirigibles and hydrogen is extremely flammable. The death toll would be astronomical over a dense population as downtown New York. Another obstacle faced in this creation was nature. The winds at the top of the Empire State Building were constantly shifting, making it difficult to control the massive airships and the idea of a dirigible dangling high above pedestrians was not safe. The last reason that the dirigibles were not safe was the existing law in the U.S. At the time of the building of the Empire State Building, a law existed that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. Therefore, the dirigible was too close to the ground and was not allowed to dock. The idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building is a phenomenal idea, however, there are too many obstacles prohibiting it, making the concept ultimately impractical and unfeasible given the safety concerns and existing regulations.
480	15313	6	3	"When the builders of the Empire State Building envisioned leading dirigibles moor at the top, there were some critical flaws. For one thing, a thousand foot dirigible moored to such a small focal point with the wind pressure and its own load would exert enormous pressure on the building's frame (p. @NUM1). The mooring forces alone would be immense. This could potentially lead to the building's collapse is due to the strain. Another reason was at such high altitudes, the wind is quite violent and would sway the back of the dirigible over thousands of pedestrians below, which is neither ""... practical nor safe."" (p. @NUM2). The airship's movements would be unpredictable. If something went wrong, the dirigible could take out another building or worse: fall. A more practical, legal obstacle was a law against the presence of airships over cities. A dirigible mooring to a mast, even at that height, was illegal (p. @NUM3). This made the entire concept unviable from a regulatory standpoint. Therefore, with so many obstacles it was deemed impractical to use the Empire State Building as a high-altitude dock."
481	15314	6	3	There are many problems with trying to dock dirigibles to the Empire State Building. First, there was a German dirigible called the Hindenburg that caught fire due to the hydrogen used for lift. Having a dirigible go up in flames over dense New York would result in many lives lost, making it a catastrophic scenario. Second, the wind 1,250 feet in the air is very strong and unpredictable, posing a significant challenge. There was no way to be sure that the dirigibles could even dock safely or be controlled once docked, creating a high risk of accidents. Lastly, there is a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which would likely be violated. It would almost certainly be against the law for a dirigible to be so close to a building with so many people in it, raising legal concerns. Since these problems all could result in deaths and considerable damage, the idea was thrown out as far too dangerous.
482	15315	6	3	"The builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In the beginning preparation, the builders thought it would be a great idea to let dirigibles (also known as blimps) to dock there. They didn't take into account the obstacles and struggles that they would soon face. The builder's didn't take into account the wind pressure and what the stress of the blimp's load would do to the building. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's Foundation, which was nearly eleven hundered feet below."" This was a huge problem and over @MONEY1 worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework. ""Safety was also another big issue."" Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable; this raised major concerns. If a fire had broken out over a highly populated area such as downtown New York, the results could have been disastrous. The winds also were a problem. Even if the blimp was tied down to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swing around and could result in a dangerous accident. There was also laws against low flying ships. Ultimately, the architects For the Empire State Building should have thought it through, as these factors combined to make the dirigible docking plan impractical and ultimately unfeasible."
483	15316	6	3	In order for the dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building the builders had to fulfill many expectations and make sure everything was right, but while doing that they faced many obstacles. The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area, making maneuvering and securing the massive airships incredibly difficult. Another obstacle the builders faced was most dirigibles from outside of the U.S. used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flameable. They realized how much worse it could be especially with a more populated area like downtown New York, increasing the potential for catastrophic accidents. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself, specifically the unpredictable weather patterns. The winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making docking a dangerous proposition. With all of these obstacles, the builders realized that this ambitious plan to integrate dirigible travel into the city's infrastructure would simply not work.
484	15317	6	3	The Empire State Building builders faced a couple of problems docking dirigibles to the mooring mast. Some, I don't even know, a lot I'll just buildup from here & one what one. The dirigible. Now I never learned about the aerodynamics of a zeppelin, but I do know one thing. Do passengers get out from the front, or sides? I don't know. The mast itself. This thing was a failure from the start. (don't question why I chose something else for one of the multi-part questions). The reason why is that because many things could go wrong. This thing can sway, & people fall off unless passengers do something really special for forging a building this high. Overall, it's been a long while, anyways these problems, & Several others that I forgot to mention for obvious reasons are also the reason why we don't use zeppelins as much anymore.
485	15318	6	3	"In the article ""The Mooring Mast,"" Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 describes how safety, laws, and nature are the three main obstacles builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Safety was the greatest reason that dirigibles could not be docked in @ORGANIZATION2. The biggest safety hazard was that many countries outside of the @LOCATION2 use hydrogen in their dirigibles instead of helium. A German dirigible had recently been destroyed in a fire in New Jersey because, ""hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@CAPS1, @NUM1). The builders of the Empire State building realized that the accident would have been far worse if it had occurred, ""above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) and by docking dirigibles there, they run the risk that it could happen. Nature was another big obstacle that hindered the success of a mooring mast. Violent air currents at the top of the Empire State Building were always causing winds to change, so because only the front of the dirigibles was tethered to the mooring mast, ""the back of the ship would swivel around"" (@CAPS1, @NUM1). They could not use lead weights to weigh down the back like they used in open fields because having weights hanging above pedestrians on the street, ""was neither practical nor safe"" (@CAPS1, @NUM1). Nature was a major obstacle because it could not be changed and there was no easy way to fix the issues it caused. The last obstacle was an existing law which prevented airships from, ""flying too low over urban areas"" (@CAPS1, @NUM5). This law made it illegal for the ship to both approach the area and tie up to the building, which was a huge obstacle that was impossible to get around. The obstacles of safety, laws, and nature that the builders of the Empire State Building faced made it impossible to dock dirigibles to the mooring mast on the building."
486	15319	6	3	The building had a steel framed body up to @NUM1 floors, then glass windows to the 102nd floor. They also had to upgrade the building due to the stress exerted by the blimps, ensuring its structural integrity could withstand the additional forces.
487	15320	6	3	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building are faced with several obstacles as they attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle they encountered was designing a mooring mast that could withstand the stress of the dirigible's load. In stanza @NUM1 the author writes, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building’s frame."" Consequently, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to ameliorate this problem. Next, the greatest obstacle they faced was the strong winds on top of the building. In stanza @NUM2, it says, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This arrived as a huge problem as the architects could not weigh down the back of the ship because it could endanger pedestrians. Lastly, in stanza @NUM3 it states there is ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" Therefore, it would be illegal for the dirigibles to tie up to the Empire State Building or even come close to the area. Due to these three obstacles the plan of using a mooring mast became an idea of the past, rendering the ambitious project impossible to realize."
488	15321	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced lots of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem they faced was putting a mooring mast on top of the building. They could not just drop a mooring mast on top, because it would cause stress towards the building that would spread to the foundation. The building's steel frame would have to be modified for the building to be able to withstand the mooring mast alone, adding to the project's complexity. Then the builders noticed that a great amount of dirigibles, from outside of the United States, were filled with hydrogen and not helium. The problem was that hydrogen is highly flammable. This was tragically shown in Lakehurst, New Jersey where the Hindenburg, a German dirigible, got into an accident and was destroyed by fire, on May 6, 1937. The builders went back and thought about how New York is a highly populated place and what kind of devastating effect a similar incident would have made on the civilians. The greatest obstacle that the builders faced was the nature of it. There were strong winds, and with a mooring mast the dirigibles would be forced to swivel and move in every direction. When the air crafts were moored in open fields they were weighed down with lead weights, but on the Empire State building they would be dangling high above civilians and pedestrians on the street, which caused great potential harm for the public. Ultimately, these combined challenges led to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan, proving the impracticality of the ambitious idea.
489	15322	6	3	The excerpt of The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted reveals that the architects of the Empire State faced a number of obstacles. Not only was the construction of the building now competitive, but its expectations were unrealistic. The idea for such a masterpiece of a building held a number of potential problems that its architects faced. As the work-in-progress of the Chrysler building grew, the Empire State Building strived to be taller. In order to achieve greater heights, its architects suggested an addition of a mooring mast, to not only make the building the tallest, but to add to its purpose. The addition of a mooring mast would require a lot of planning, though. If a giant steel framed balloon were to dock at the top of the building as is, it could dangerously shake the foundation of the building, so the frame of the building had to be rebuilt much stronger. Also, the architects didn't realize the danger of docking dirigibles. Dirigibles, or blimps, were fueled by hydrogen, which is very flammable, and proved a threat to the thousands of people living below, demonstrating the unrealistic nature of the mooring mast concept and highlighting the challenges the architects faced in their ambitious pursuit of height and innovation.
490	15323	6	3	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles attempting to allow dirigibles, also known as blimps, to dock there. Some of these obstacles faced by the builders were that the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building. Attaching a thousand-foot dirigible to the top of the building's frame ""would add stress to the building's frame,"" @CAPS1 states in paragraph @NUM1. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly @NUM2 feet below"". Furthermore, it was very unsafe allowing the highly flammable dirigible to coast over a highly populated area, posing a significant risk to the city below. Lastly, the article states, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" The ship would ""swivel"" around the mooring mast, making docking procedures unpredictable and hazardous. Ultimately, dirigibles should be landing in open fields, where they could not dangle precariously above pedestrians, highlighting the impracticality of the mooring mast concept for the Empire State Building."
491	15324	6	3	There were plenty of obstacles the builder faced in trying to allow the dirigibles to dock here are some. First, having something this big land on a 1250 foot building would add lots of stress to the building's frame. All of this stress would have to be distributed throughout the eleven hundred foot building, which was unthought of. In order to make the building suitable for all this weight, it would cost over sixty thousand dollars, and that was a lot considering everything else that they were doing. Those were just a few obstacles they had in trying to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building, ultimately making the prospect impractical due to structural and financial concerns.
492	15325	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building ran into some obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Because of all the modifications they would need to make in order to have a mooring mast would cost over sixty thousand dollars. It was such an expensive modification because they ""could not simply drop a mooring mast on the top of the"" flat roof on the Empire State Building. The stress a thousand-foot dirigible would put on the building's frame would be too much; this was their obstacle, requiring extensive reinforcement. The builders needed to strengthen and modify the steel frame of the Empire State Building in order to hold the dirigibles as desired, which ultimately proved to be an impractical and cost-prohibitive endeavor."
493	15326	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a lot of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building. Mainly the idea was just not practical. Having an up to 1000 foot blimp full of flammable hydrogen hovering over a densely populated area was an extreme danger. One accident and tons of lives would be at stake. Especially after the German blimp the Hindenburg crashed, workers knew, had that happened in New York their death tolls would be huge. Along with the extreme perils that the builders knew would be at stake, mother nature would also not make it easy for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. The winds atop the building were constantly shifting. The air currents were too violent and posed too many threats for danger. Even when the ship was anchored, the back of the ship would swivel as if attached to a hinge. Lead tools can be used to weigh down the blimp, but hanging above tons of people this would not be a safe idea. Overall the idea of having a dirigible connected to the Empire State Building is just not safe and not worth what could be lost.
494	15327	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A significant challenge was the actual design of the mooring and modifications that would have to be made to the building. Due to the stress of the wind pressure and the load of the dirigible, the building's structure had to be made stronger to accommodate these forces. The mast would also have to withstand holding down the dirigible with just one cable tether, which would put a lot of stress on the mast and building. Another issue faced by the builders was the fact that dirigibles from outside the United States mostly used hydrogen, not helium, in the balloon, which made it more flammable and dangerous. If one ever caught on fire above New York City, it would be disastrous, endangering countless lives. Finally, there was already a law in place that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. This law made it so that it was illegal for a ship to ever tie up to, or even approach the Empire State Building, rendering the docking plan legally infeasible. In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges, most too great to overcome, when it came to trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the spire of the building.
495	15328	6	3	"There are a few obstacles the builders had to face in this project. One of them was building the Empire State Building taller than the Chrysler building. The architect of the Chrysler building made it 46 ft taller. When this was done, the builder needed to make the Empire State building taller, but make it something ""as mundane as a water tank"" (@NUM1 ∂ Al Smith). Another example was trying to make it a stop for dirigibles. These things could go up two @NUM2 miles per hour. They were as long as 1 thousand ft. That would take up @NUM3 blocks in New York City. They didn't have a good landing area, either. A third obstacle they faced was nature, because the wind was always blowing. No matter what, hanging dirigibles over a city of innocent people was very dangerous, and ultimately, impractical."
496	15329	6	3	While planning this architectural masterpiece, builders faced many obstacles. This plan to have a mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building definitely did not fulfill expectations. The first big problem was the large amounts of stress to the framework of the building when the zeppelins would be moored to the top; also, the amount of pull would impact the foundation as well, potentially destabilizing the entire structure. The second problem was the cost to modify the skyscraper to meet the needs to not stress the framework, making the project economically unfeasible. Safety was a huge issue as well; most blimps are filled with hydrogen which is a highly flammable gas, also if it were to explode it is floating over one of the largest cities in the country, endangering countless lives. With New York's geographical positioning the wind is very strong off the ocean, these violent air currents constantly shift directions which could cause the zeppelin to crash into the building, risking damage to the skyscraper and the airship. The final obstacle was the law against airships, they could not fly too low over highly populated urban cities, rendering the mooring mast essentially useless. Ultimately, these challenges led to the abandonment of the airship mooring concept, proving it to be impractical.
497	15330	6	3	Four main obstacles prevented dirigibles from ever docking at the Empire State Building. The first was that a much more complex mooring mast would have to be installed on top of the Empire State Building, a very different mast than the regular masts found in open field docking areas. When a dirigible would dock on the mast it would cause great stress to the building's frame, a problem that could be solved by increasing the strength of the steel frame. Another problem was that a dirigible was made of hydrogen and could easily catch fire and explode. Engineers saw this would cause large problems over a densely populated area like New York City. Once the mast was built a new problem arose, even if the dirigible could dock the intense winds could make the back end of the dirigible move violently, or cause an airship to be unable to dock, like the incident with the Los Angeles. Nor could they use lead weights to weigh down the balloon since they would be a danger to civilians below. Lastly, a law against airships flying too low over urban areas could have prevented docking. Considering these significant challenges, it's understandable why no airship ever successfully moored to the Empire State Building, despite a couple of attempts that came close.
498	15331	6	3	"Basically this excerpt is talking about the ""The Mooring Mast"". It is all about the construction. One of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced was safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This reveals that the dirigibles they planned to accommodate were highly flammable, posing a significant risk to people's lives; a fire at that altitude could be catastrophic. The other obstacle the builders faced was existing law. ""The other reason practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" Even though the building was the tallest in New York, it was still too low to comply with regulations, as airships couldn't fly that low over urban areas due to the risk of accidents. The Empire State Building, over 1,250 feet tall, was subject to strong and forceful winds, making it difficult for dirigibles to moor, as ""In December 1930, the U.S Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful wind."" Ultimately, these factors made the mooring mast concept impractical."
499	15332	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One such obstacle was the amount of modifications that needed to be made to the building's framework, as stated in paragraph @NUM1. The other obstacle they faced was the fact that most countries outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable; this made it impossible for dirigibles to stop in a densely populated area such as downtown New York, as stated in paragraph @NUM2. A last obstacle they faced was existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. These various challenges ultimately made the dirigible docking plan impractical for the Empire State Building.
500	15333	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building faced obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. Wind caused a great problem in the docking of the dirigibles. ""The body of the dirigible could swing in the breeze"" (para 6). The swinging of the dirigibles body would cause pulling on the building that the building's current frame wouldn't be able to support. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below"" (para @NUM1). The builders of the Empire State Building now had to strengthen and modify the building's frame to suit the stress of the dirigibles' loads, adding to the complexity and cost of the project. Another obstacle that the builders of the building faced was the framing of the mast. The roof had to be completed before the mast's framing could take place, adding to the already tight construction schedule. The workers had to work for another two months after the building was already complete due to Al Smith's idea of allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, further delaying the full use of the skyscraper. The builders worked hard to suit the new building for the docking of dirigibles. Unfortunately their work was for nothing, as the logistical and safety challenges proved too great for regular dirigible service."
501	15334	6	3	"Attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building created many obstacles for its builders, some of which weren't even discovered until finally attempting to do it. The first of the builders' problems started with trying to prepare the actual building for the added stress that would be applied when having dirigibles try to dock. They spent @MONEY1 on modifications to reinforce the framework of the building. Then ""Rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower..."" This created lots of unnecessary work for the workers, as well as made obstacles. There was also a lot of danger associated with docking dirigibles that the builders had to deal with. The violent, changing air currents would require them to make the mast as sturdy as possible and account for the movement of the dirigibles. Finally, the builders found out the biggest obstacle, which is that it is illegal for airships to fly that low over urban areas, so technically they weren't even allowed to do what they did. Thinking back on it, it is obvious to see that ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose..."" because of these various unforeseen problems and the ultimate illegality of the entire endeavor."
502	15335	6	3	"There were some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the violent wind currents that made the dirigibles rear swivel, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around."" A second obstacle was a law preventing airships from flying too low over urban areas, which essentially rendered the mast nearly useless for practical docking procedures. A third obstacle was that foreign dirigibles often used hydrogen, a gas that is highly flammable and posed a significant safety risk. After the dirigible called ""The Hindenburg"" was destroyed in a fiery blaze, ""the owners realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as New York."" Ultimately, the inherent dangers and logistical challenges proved insurmountable, leading to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan."
503	15336	6	3	Based on the excerpt The mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, the @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were fire, wind, and the laws against airships flying to low over urban areas. If they let the dirigibles dock there they would risk the dirigibles @CAPS2 on fire because dirigibles from outside the U.S. used hydrogen instead of helium, and the Hydrogen is highly flammable. Another Obstacle would be the Wind; the winds were Shifting because of violent air currents. The back of the ship would swivel around, and if they put weights on the back it would not be safe for pedestrians on the street. And the last obstacle would be the law against airships flying to low over urban area, I would make it illegal for a Ship to tie to the building. Those were the @CAPS1 they faced, making the ambitious plan ultimately impractical and unsafe.
504	15337	6	3	"The expectation for dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building was very high. The men who built the massive structure should've realized that these expectations were unrealistic. Al Smith had planned for dirigibles to refuel and to drop off/pick up passengers while docked at the @ORGANIZATION1. These plans would never manifest because dirigibles were powered by hydrogen and it is highly flammable which could result in disaster, the winds atop the Empire State Building were much too strong, and there was a law permitting aircraft's from flying so low over urban areas. In one incident in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire. The owners of the @ORGANIZATION1 saw ""How much worse that accident could have been [in New York City]."" ""The greatest obstacle to use of the mooring mass was nature itself"" because the wind was so strong. Dirigibles couldn't even get close enough to dock. The law on the altitude of airships wouldn't allow dirigibles to even get close to the @ORGANIZATION1. The plans for the Empire State Building were never realistic and could never be fulfilled."
505	15338	6	3	The wind was a huge issue when building the Empire State Building. The building was so high off the ground that the top was not as stable, which posed a significant engineering challenge. If they used dirigibles on the Empire State Building it would be dangerous because the weights would be dangling high in the air over all of the pedestrians' heads. That plan was not smart or safe, considering the potential for accidents. The purpose to build it higher was just so it could be the tallest building, there was really no good reason for it other than prestige. Therefore, the risks associated with its height and the impracticality of proposed solutions highlight a focus on ambition over practicality.
506	15339	6	3	Elders of the Empire State Building faced many complications. Safety was a major concern for workers during construction. Battling with the harsh winds at such heights would also be a problem when erecting the mooring mast. When the idea of the mast was created, not many realized the reality of the concept. To put an extremely heavy object and attach it to just a tether, was not safe enough and raised concerns about structural integrity. The combination of combustible gases used in dirigibles also suggested pulling down town New York at risk in the event of an accident. To land on such a small roof would be difficult due to strong winds and limited visibility. Guiding the dirigible to such a delicate landing would prove to be hazardous with the strong winds potentially causing a crash. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when constructing the mooring mast, and addressing these challenges was crucial for the project's success and the safety of the city.
507	15340	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First the building had a flat roof and a dirigible moored to the top, only held by a single cable tether would add stress to the building's frame. Modifications to the building would cost over sixty thousand dollars, a considerable sum at the time. Other problems the building faced had to do with safety. Some dirigibles used hydrogen which is highly flammable and if an accident were to happen in New York it would be disastrous, potentially causing a large explosion. The greatest obstacle was nature itself. The winds were constantly shifting and even tethered to the mooring mast, the ship would not be secured. This was also very unsafe, making passenger transfer extremely hazardous. Ultimately, the Empire State Building never succeeded in its intended purpose of being a dirigible docking station due to these insurmountable challenges."
508	15341	6	3	"The main problem in the original design of the mooring mast was that ""the architects could'nt just drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. The stress of the dirigible's load & the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation."" Another obstacle the builders faced with the construction of the mast could be another example of the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"". With some dirigibles using the highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium another ""Hindenburg accident"" could prove to be fatal in a ""highly populated area such as downtown New York,"" causing immense devastation. Perhaps the greatest obstacle would be ""nature itself."" The high force winds on top of the empire state building would cause the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast. Although the dirigibles could be weighted down, the weights would be hanging over pedestrians, which ""was neither practical nor safe,"" ultimately making the mooring concept unfeasible."
509	15342	6	3	The obstacles the builder of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were a lot. They had trouble with the area where they were going to do their job. The key obstacle in their plan's expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Another obstacle that they had was with the mooring mast. Arguably, the greatest obstacle to the success of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, creating an unpredictable environment. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast, presenting considerable danger. Then there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Therefore, if dirigibles violated this regulation, it would become illegal for the ship to tie up to the building or even approach the area, effectively rendering the docking station unusable. Ultimately, these compounding issues made the dirigible docking concept impractical.
510	15343	6	3	the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was even constructed. The greatest reason was one of safety: most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, making the prospect of mooring a massive airship filled with it to the top of a skyscraper in the middle of a bustling city incredibly dangerous. The impracticality of safely docking and disembarking passengers ultimately sealed the mast's fate.
511	15344	6	3	In the 1930's, the idea to have a mooring mast mounted on the top of the Empire State Building for dirigibles to dock was a very popular theory. However, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced, such as existing laws concerning airships, flammable, hydrogen dirigibles, strong winds, and the stress a moored dirigible would add to the buildings frame. Existing air traffic laws would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to the Empire State Building or even fly near it, since airships couldn't fly too low over urban areas (paragraph @NUM1). The destruction of the Hindenburg, a hydrogen dirigible, helped the owners of the Empire State building realize how dangerous dirigibles could be, especially if they combusted over downtown New York City (paragraph @NUM2). Strong winds also would be hazardous to dirigibles moored to the empire state building, seeing as the aircrafts couldn't be way down in the air (paragraph @NUM3). The steel frame of the building would also have to be modified to accommodate the stress added by a moored dirigible. Essentially, the added weight and pull would require significant structural reinforcement. All in all, it was very unrealistic to moor dirigibles to the Empire State Building, as it would be unsafe.
512	15345	6	3	"Builders faced many obstacles such as safety, nature, flammability and law in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the mast. The first problem is ""the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill it's purpose."" The dirigibles also, use hydrogen not helium, which is very flammable. The Hindenburg, a German dirigible was destroyed by fire in New Jersey and, ""the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse [it] could have been if it [happened] over densely populated area such as New York. The violent air currents also played a role, the back of the ship would swivel around and around. When dirigibles moored in landing fields they would be weighted down with lead weights, which would be dangerous for pedestrians on the street. Also, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Because of these combined factors, there was no way dirigibles would be able to dock at the mast."
513	15346	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building in New York faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. One obstacle of the builders was creating the Empire State Building with the strength to hold the dirigible, swaying in the wind, without the building falling over. The weight of the dirigible would have to be transferred to the bottom of the building which was almost eleven hundred feet below. The largest obstacle, however, was holding the dirigible in place while it was docked atop the building. The winds were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" and would make the dirigible fly wildly around the top of the building. Moreover, the mooring mast itself presented engineering challenges. The building would never be used for its transportational purpose because of the dangers and obstacles of the mooring mast and dirigibles."
514	15347	6	3	While designing and building the mooring mast atop the Empire State building, the engineers seem to have ignored some seemingly useful information. As with any vehicle in the air or at sea, wind is either your enemy, or your friend. The engineers should have taken into greater consideration that changing wind speeds and direction 1,250 feet in the air are huge threats. Your dirigible will have a hard time getting close enough to the mast to moor, never mind to stay steady enough for passengers to exit, and board safely. Attempting to dock a massive airship in such conditions presents enormous challenges. Also if the law itsself prevented you from floating your blimp at such low altitudes, then its game over. Why even bother if its illegal? Ultimately, although it seems like a futuristic sci-fi, and not to mention downright cool way to land a blimp, too many practical and legal obstacles prevented the idea from prevailing.
515	15348	6	3	There were many obstacles that the Empire State buildings owner faced. One obstacle was not having enough room for the dirigible to land. To help solve this problem, the architect added a mooring mast to increase the building's height. Another obstacle was that the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be expanded in order for there to be more height added to the building, as the original structure was not designed for such stress. Altogether this would cost over @MONEY1. The main reason, and obstacle was safety, especially concerning potential accidents during docking. The owner had to make sure that the dirigible was not flammable, in which it was. Wind and nature also played a big part in deciding to go through with the idea. The strong winds would make the dirigible swing and constantly shift. This would make the dirigible hang over people on the streets of New York, which was not safe, and could lead to potential disasters. The idea that landing dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building was neither safe or practical, and there were just too many struggles and obstacles for a plan like this to ever follow through. Ultimately, the impracticality and inherent dangers led to the abandonment of this ambitious concept.
516	15349	6	3	The builders faced many obstacles while building the mooring mast on the Empire State Building. One thing was just simply the building would not have been strong enough to hold the dirigibles weight. Due to that fact that, they had to strengthen all the framework on the entire building. They had to put in sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications to its framework to ensure structural integrity. Also having the right equipment on the dirigibles served as a problem. The dirigibles didn't have the right docking tools to dock on this newly built mooring mast, requiring further adaptation. The back of the dirigibles could also be swung back and forth when docked which also served as a issue When it came to docking, presenting a challenge for passenger transfer. Another problem was most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen which was highly flammable and they didn't want something that could easily catch fire near the building like that, creating a significant safety hazard that needed to be addressed. These difficulties ultimately contributed to the mooring mast's limited use.
517	15350	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The main reason the dirigibles couldn't dock there was because of the dirigibles' load, which would cause stress on the structure. The wind pressure also is another reason dirigibles couldn't dock there, as ""the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation,"" potentially compromising its integrity. The dirigibles were to be docked by means of an electric winch. While the electric winch seemed adequate, it also says ""the dirigible could swing in the breeze,"" and this instability could have been a major safety concern for passengers and the building itself. Ultimately, these factors contributed to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan."
518	15351	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, one was safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (@NUM1) This shows that docking dirigibles can be harmful as some buildings and many people can be negatively affected. The large business district is too densely populated to allow such a thing. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@NUM2) This obstacle builders faced brought up that lives are yet again in danger, not to mention very expensive damage that allowing dirigibles can cause. This made the already risky proposition even more daunting. Another obstacle builders faced was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" (@NUM3) These regulations further complicated the docking plans. All of these obstacles that the builders faced were very important and paved the way for the idea of dirigibles to be docked attop of the Empire State Building to be disarmed. The dangers involved were too significance and the top of the building now much safer purposes."
519	15352	6	3	"There were many problems with the designing of the dirigible docking system. The first of these problems comes from the practicality of the concept. The winds created by the updrafts in the cities are violent and making landing a blimp too risky, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Another obstacle that was faced was the structural design, specifically, ensuring the mooring mast could withstand the forces exerted by a large airship in high winds. The Empire State Building was not originally designed to moor blimps, and modifying the building to do so was expensive, ""over @NUM1 dollars' worth of modifications,"" making the project financially burdensome. The final obstacle was the fact that there were laws in place stopping airships from flying too low over buildings, ""... an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" These impracticalities proved to be challenging obstacles that ultimately made the dirigible docking system unfeasible."
520	15353	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building planned to use the building to make New York the leader in modern travel. They built a mooring mast which they planned to use to dock dirigibles. Unfortunately, there were some unexpected difficulties and this goal was never accomplished. When the architects first decided to add the mast to the Empire State Building, they realized that they would have to redesign the entire building's support structure because of the pressure that a docked dirigible would put on the building. Even after this problem was solved, there were numerous obstacles keeping the goal from being reached.  The architects had failed to foresee many of the potential problems with the mast. Not until after the mast was built did they realize that most dirigibles from outside the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium to stay afloat. Hydrogen, being highly flammable, was not a risk that the builders wanted to take over the densely populated city. The architects also realized that the unpredictable high winds at the top of the mast would be too dangerous to dock a dirigible.  Once these obstacles appeared, it became evident that the Empire State Building would never dock a dirigible, and the mooring mast eventually became a simple broadcast antenna.
521	15354	6	3	"Builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles during construction, according to the article The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted. The biggest obstacle of allowing dirigibles, or blimps, to dock their where the forces of nature, such as wind and gravity. As in the article, the ""winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" It was unsafe for both passengers of the dirigible and pedestrians below to be close to the blimp and the turbulent air. Also, the flammability of the hydrogen in the blimp caused a problem; it was very unsafe to have a possible fire hazard that was 700 feet long, floating close over a very populated place such as New York City. In addition to that, laws that airships could not fly too close over urban areas prohibited dirigibles even coming close to the mooring mast over the Empire State Building. A test run with the U.S. navy dirigible Los Angeles proved that it was too dangerous and impractical; the dirigible could not even get close enough to tie up. All in all, the mooring mast over the Empire State Building was a genius idea, but too many obstacles sprung up for it to be in use."
522	15355	6	3	Architects had to face many problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. The very first problem architects faced was adding a mooring mast to the building; because they could not simply just drop one on, they had to go back and re-support the whole skeleton of the building. Another problem was that if the dirigible were to fail, like the Hindenburg, it would plummet in a ball of fire to a very populated city down below. The greatest problem architects had to face was nature itself. There were violent winds constantly; if a dirigible had been tethered down, it would move violently and crash down on pedestrians below, which was too much of a risk for the architects to take. These safety and structural concerns ultimately made the dirigible docking plan unfeasible.
523	15356	6	3	When attempting to add a mooring mast to the Empire State Building, the people who were adding it faced several impediments. Right away, the builders took the size of a dirigible into account. If there were something that large at the top of the building, the frame would be warped. To solve this problem, they had to spend over sixty thousand dollars to change the original framework, to a more suitable one that could withstand the stress. Another obstacle faced by the builders of the mast, was that they had made sharp edges on the building that could damage a dirigible attempting to dock, possibly tearing the delicate fabric. Also, they realized that the mast was above a large urban area, so if there would be an accident, catastrophic situations would take place. There was also a law about aircraft traveling too low over a City, which would make dirigible docking impractical. The dirigible mooring dock atop the Empire State Building was not meant to be, and these challenges ultimately proved insurmountable.
524	15357	6	3	There were many obstacles the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch. The greatest obstacle of the mooring mast was nature. The winds on top of the building were shifting because of violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, an approach that was neither practical nor safe on a skyscraper. The one obstacle to their use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on, but ultimately, the unpredictable weather conditions made this ambitious plan unfeasible.
525	15358	6	3	"There were many different obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, an existing law made it so that airships could not fly too low over urban areas, which meant that a dirigible could not tie up to the building or approach the area. Another problem was making the mast strong enough to support a dirigible. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" This shows that improvements had to be made to the mast to handle the immense weight and wind resistance. One of the biggest problems of building the mast was the issue of the dirigibles being filled with hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. The owners of the building remembered the German dirigible Hindenburg, which was destroyed by fire in 1937, and how much worse the accident would have been if it had taken place in a densely populated area; these safety concerns ultimately contributed to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan."
526	15359	6	3	There were a few obstacles builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A dirigible is a blimp, giant steel balloons that are filled with hydrogen and helium. Dirigibles had a lack of suitable landing area in New York. Al Smith was a four-term governor of New York. He came up with the idea that a mooring mast being added to the Empire State building would allow dirigibles to anchor there, fuel up and passengers could safely get on and off the dirigible. The architects and builders had to consult with experts so they took workers at the New York University, tested the mass and met with president of a recently formed airship transport company. After all those obstacles they could finally build the mooring mast, though the high winds at that altitude ultimately made the docking idea impractical, and it was abandoned shortly after the building's completion.
527	15360	6	3	"The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted describes the building of the mast of the Empire State Building. The mast was originally added to add height to the thousand foot building. However Al Smith, one of the builders, wanted the mast to ""serve the higher calling"" of providing a docking station for dirigibles. This idea proved to be very challenging. First, the builders had to change the structure of the tower to make it strong enough to support the weight of the dirigible swaying in the wind. L¸sted writes, ""The stress of the dirigible's load... Would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation..."" requiring significant reinforcement. When the mast was finally built, the builders faced the problem of having the dirigibles ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street."" If one ever fell, hundreds of people will be killed. Finally, there was a law that prevented ""airships flying too low over urban areas."" By docking at the Empire State Building, the dirigibles would be breaking that law, making the entire endeavor illegal. Although it was a good idea, ""The Mooring Mast"" shows that it would not be possible for dirigibles to dock atop the Empire State Building."
528	15361	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there, with safety being the biggest concern at each stage of the plan. The recent explosion of the Hindenburg showed potential problems inherent in docking these massive aircraft. If a blimp was to explode in downtown New York, the resulting inferno could be a disaster of immense proportions. Another obstacle that would be faced is the unpredictability of nature. The winds on the top of the building were constantly changing direction and speed. The unpredictable wind atop the building made the idea of mooring a zeppelin a very illogical and dangerous proposition. Furthermore, at this time, laws against flying low in urban areas were beginning to be considered and put in place. These new regulations would make docking the airships a legally dubious, if not outright illegal, activity. The initial idea for making the Empire State Building a mooring post was undoubtedly an impressive engineering feat, showcasing human ingenuity, but the actual usage of it was ultimately not practical, due to a convergence of safety concerns, unpredictable weather, and evolving legal restrictions.
529	15362	6	3	The obstacles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock is that a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building would add stress to the building's frame. Also the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted. It would need to transmitted to the buildings foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame would have to be modified and strengthened; this would cost over sixty thousand dollars, making the docking plan an expensive and structurally challenging undertaking.
530	15363	6	3	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced were really difficult. The workers had to make sure that the building wasn't so tall that it would tilt, requiring precise calculations and engineering. The workers also faced competition; they needed their building to be the biggest, and they didn't give up until their building was officially the tallest building in the world.
531	15364	6	3	Builders trying to allow dirigibles to dock ontop of the empire state building faced problems. The dirigibles weight and the wind pressure would add stress to the building, which HAD to be transmitted more then 80 ft down to the buildings foundation. Construction wasn't the only problem. Most NON-American dirigibles are held afloat by hydrogen which is extremely flammable, and if it was LEAKED over busy + crowded New York streets many people could have been killed. Nature added to the problems. Wind currents had the potential to push dirigibles INTO NEARBY buildings, causing them to pop. The final problem was REGULATIONS already in place which didn't allow low flying aircrafts. Builders faced problems with nature, REGULATIONS, safety, and construction which lead to the demise of the use of the mooring system. Therefore, a multitude of factors, ranging from structural concerns to safety hazards and regulatory restrictions, collectively prevented the successful implementation of the dirigible mooring system.
532	15365	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced tremendous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, new features would necessitate more money. Anything done atop a building so large would have to be balanced by strengthening the foundation. According to paragraph 3, ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" Another large obstacle the builders would have to deal with was finding a way to neutralize the violent wind currents atop the 1,250 ft. building. Even if the front of the dirigible was anchored to the mooring, the back would be left to sway in the wind. Any accident or damage done to a dirigible over such a highly populated area such as downtown New York would have devastating results. In conclusion, the risks of allowing dirigibles to dock atop the Empire State Building outweighed the rewards, and as dirigible travel became less practical, the plan was scrapped completely."
533	15366	6	3	Many obstacles were taken while trying to get the Empire State Building to allow dirigibles to dock there; this was a long, hard and thought out process. Workers couldn't just drop a mooring mast on top of the building's roof. A one thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, which added stress to the building's frame. The architects also had to build a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building, further complicating construction. Later on they realized dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building, one reason being a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Architects went through many obstacles in building masts, and in the end, the impracticality of the entire endeavor became clear.
534	15367	6	3	"Problems the builders of the Empire State Building came across were some tricky, life-threatening ones. The first being as mentioned in paragraph @NUM1, concerned the potential danger of a dirigible docking gone wrong. It explains that if a dirigible was to try and dock and something went wrong and it caught on fire, there would be serious damage done to the people below on the streets. Another obstacle the builders had to deal with was the ""greatest obstacle"" in paragraph @NUM2: the fact that the wind atop the tower would be whipping the dirigible around with just a cable holding it to the mooring mast. Not making it safe for anyone around the building or in the blimp. One other reason the builders had to figure out when building the mast, was that no airships flying low could enter the area as mentioned in paragraph @NUM3, because of the high winds and the danger of hitting other buildings. Those are some of the problems the builders had to face if they wished to dock dirigibles on the building, highlighting the significant safety and logistical challenges involved."
535	15368	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted explains the Empire State building's past construction which led it to be the tallest building in the United States. Although the builder Al Smith had many obstacles, they faced one of the hardest ones when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles is allowing dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on. Another obstacle is letting dirigibles dock because they need a place to tie up to a mast. It is stated, ""Dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mast"" (L¸sted @NUM1). This can be a problem because the body of the mast could swing in a lot of breeze, making docking a perilous endeavor. Although there were many obstacles, Al Smith worked his way around them and proceeded to finish the Empire State building with courage to take on all obstacles."
536	15369	6	3	"In this excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"", Popular Mechanics describes the architectural, chemical, and legal challenges that prevented the construction of a mooring dock for dirigibles on the top of the Empire State Building. Despite the readiness of then- New York Governor Al Smith, who publicly announced the plan, and of John Tauranac, who reported that the top of the Empire State Building ""would serve a higher calling [than] to add a desired few feet,"" Popular Mechanics contends that the failure of the mast ""should have been apparent before it was ever constructed"". According to the article, the mast, and a moored dirigible, ""would add stress to the building's frame."" More than sixty thousand dollars was spent to accommodate the pressure. Foreign dirigibles also contained hydrogen, which was more flammable than American-used helium. An explosion above the Empire State Building would be devastating to the city. An existing law prevented dirigibles from ""even approach[ing]"" the building. Popular Mechanics uses these reasons to detail the unrealistic nature of the mooring mast, highlighting a confluence of factors that ultimately doomed the ambitious project from the start."
537	15370	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were difficult. One of the obstacles they faced was fixing the Empire State Building, and the cost was high. For example, the excerpt said, ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation; over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" The plan never fully went through because safety was an issue. Fire and people getting hurt on the streets was a big risk they could not make. Furthermore, it was also illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas, adding another layer of complexity. The obstacles that the builders had to face ultimately made the idea impossible to happen."
538	15371	6	3	The architects had few problems. As said in @LOCATION1, stress from the Dirigibles Load was too much for The building. They would @CAPS1 spend over sixty thousand Dollars of modifications. Other Then That They @CAPS2 redesigned And then made it. After these changes, the building met all safety standards.
539	15372	6	3	"In the short story, ""The Mooring Mast,"" there were obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles dock there. One problem was that the dirigible's load and the wind pressure on the building's foundation. ""The stress of the dirigible's load into the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" This presented a significant engineering challenge, as the immense weight and force exerted by the airship in windy conditions could potentially compromise the building's structural integrity. This was a big obstacle for the landing process of the dirigibles. Another problem they had was that dirigibles use hydrogen, and hydrogen is highly flammable. ""The Mooring Mast of the Empire State Building was destined never to fulfill it's purpose. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" If the dirigible caught the building on fire, many people's lives would be in complete danger, creating a catastrophic risk. In conclusion, the Mooring Mast did not work out for many reasons, but safety and the dirigible's load and wind pressure on the building's foundation were two big obstacles for allowing dirigibles to dock."
540	15373	6	3	"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were numerous, but the main obstacles consisted of the danger that dirigibles posed, nature, and an existing law against letting airships fly too low over the suburban areas. According to the reading, the danger that dirigibles posed was that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is considered highly flammable"". This danger was emphasized by the German dirigible Hindenburg when it was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, dramatically illustrating the potential for catastrophe. Nature was also a great obstacle because of the ""winds on top of the building"" that ""were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". Because of these winds, it was almost impossible to dock a dirigible on the mooring mast without it moving around crazily, making the entire endeavor impractical. The last obstacle, the law, ""would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. Unless the law was revoked, the mooring mast would never be able to work. However, the obstacle that the builders faced when designing the actual mast itself were that ""the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened"" because ""the stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"" which turned out to be ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications,"" highlighting the financial burden of reinforcing the structure. Thus, a combination of safety concerns, environmental factors, legal restrictions, and structural challenges ultimately led to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan, despite initial enthusiasm."
541	15374	6	3	During the construction of the Empire State Building the builders had to face many difficulties in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In the reading selection The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted it discusses many of the difficulties that were faced. For an example an obstacle they had to face was finding a landing area because there was a huge lack of suitable landing area in New York City. The second difficulty they faced was how to make dirigible's global so they had a meeting with the president of a formed airship transport company that would use the dirigible's service across the pacific ocean. The architects had meetings with the government about safeways of mooring airships to this mast. The builders went through many difficulties to use the dirigibles but eventually it wasn't enough to put the plan into affect.
542	15375	6	3	"One obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was how to do it safely. According to the reading, it says that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Another obstacle was nature itself. This sentence, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" located at the beginning of paragraph @NUM1, proves that docking dirigibles at the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building was unsafe. Last but not @CAPS1, another reason why dirigibles could not dock was because it was illegal. There was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" Because of that law, it would make it illegal for dirigibles to even approach the area. Therefore, it would be impossible for a ship to land there."
543	15376	6	3	"The builders of the Empire States Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For instance, in paragraph one, the author mentions that they had to consider the Hindenburg incident that took place on May 6, 1937, ""The owners of the Empire State building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York,"" says the author. They realized that the safety of the people has to come first in all scenarios. Also, another obstacle that Al Smith and the builders faced was docking the dirigible when people are down below. In paragraph two, The author says: ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Large dirigibles are often docked in open fields, weights to hold down the back of the ship could be used safely. But above a highly populated area was out of the question because lead weights dangling high above pedestrians is a safety violation. Ultimately, the builders had many obstacles in designing the use of the mooring mast, making the prospect of dirigible docking a complex and ultimately impractical endeavor."
544	15377	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The thousand foot dirigible on top the Empire State Building could add significant stress to the building's frame. The stress from the dirigible was far too much to carry, and the frame of the building would have had to have been extensively modified and strengthened to be able to hold the dirigible. There were also many inherent risks taken by attempting to land a dirigible atop the Empire State Building, making the prospect ultimately unfeasible.
545	15378	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the problems was that a thousand-foot dirigible held by a single cable tether would add stress to the frame. The obstacle they went through was to make the frame stronger. In paragraph @NUM1 it states the obstacle they went through to make the building stronger: ""the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower"" and ""The rocket-shaped mast would have four wings at its corners."" Other obstacles they went through was making sure the mooring mast was tall enough, and in paragraph @NUM2 Smith says, ""people in Washington are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast."" Ultimately, despite the effort and innovative designs, the impracticality and safety concerns surrounding dirigible docking led to the abandonment of the plan."
546	15379	6	3	"The builders from this excerpt faced quite a few challenges in trying to let dirigibles dock there. First off, the whole structure of the Empire State Building would need to be altered. Having a mooring mast atop the building with a dirigible attached would put great amounts of stress on the building's frame. The stainless steel in the structure's frame would need to be modified to be made stronger, however this is very costly. The excerpt says, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). Another challenge the builders faced was trying to deal with existing laws that had already been in place. The government did not want aircrafts flying too low over buildings, thus presenting a legal obstacle. The excerpt says, ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against aircrafts flying too low over urban areas."" (paragraph @NUM2). The excerpt also says that this law would make it illegal for an aircraft to ever tie up to a building or even approach it, effectively preventing any dirigible from docking as initially planned. These structural and legal hurdles ultimately made the dirigible docking idea impractical."
547	15380	6	3	"There were three main obstacles in building a dock for dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building. The first problem was safety. Most dirigibles from outside of the U.S. were flammable because they ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" When the Hindenburg was destroyed, they realized that it would have been much worse over a highly populated city like New York. Another problem was nature. Winds were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" making docking a large airship precarious. The back of the dirigible would ""swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" further complicating the landing procedure. The third problem was that there was a law in place. As L¸sted says, ""[there] was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" meaning that the building would have to be much taller in order for the ships to even approach it safely and legally. These issues ultimately made the ambitious dirigible dock impractical."

You never know at times you have to tear things down for hard work to be completed right. When looking at you did right things to prevent bad things from occurring. You may face a whole bunch of things when building. The Empire faced attempts; one allowed to dock when building the dirigibles to the dock was not performed or built right.

It helps you reminded of your wells done correctly, and the challenges overcome contribute to a sense of accomplishment, solidifying the satisfaction derived from a job well done.
549	15382	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems in attempting the dirigibles to dock there. Some of the most apparent reasons were because of what the dirigibles were made out of, weather conditions, and existing laws about airships flying over urban areas. Dirigibles were not made out of the safest materials, most were made with hydrogen, which is extremely flammable. This would make the docking station unsafe if the dirigible ever caught on fire. If the dirigible were to ever get caught on fire, the accident would be very severe, since the station would be over a densely populated area. In paragraph @NUM1, it says ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Due to the violent air currents atop the Empire State Building, the ship would swivel around the mooring mast, making it unsafe to dock there. If something happened to the dirigible, it would be unsafe for the many pedestrians below it. The last reason for the docking station not being built is in paragraph @NUM2 because of ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" It would be illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the docking station because of this law, preventing its practical use. This law is because of the high winds, fearing that they would blow the dirigible onto other buildings. The docking station was unable to be built because of safety reasons and existing laws."
550	15383	6	3	significant challenge as they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. The largest problems the builders encountered were due to safety and actually mooring the dirigible itself. The hydrogen used within the dirigible was unsafe, as hydrogen is very flammable. If the hydrogen caught on fire, especially over a place as densely populated as New York City, many people would be harmed. Additionally, the builders were faced with the task of mooring the dirigible. Dirigibles were normally anchored with heavy lead weights. However, if one used those weights to anchor the dirigible above city streets, pedestrians below could potentially be injured. Actually allowing the dirigible to dock brought up another problem for the builders to address: if the dirigible was tethered to the mast on top of the Empire State Building, the dirigible would swings around and around the mast to wind. Ultimately, the builders were unable to address these issues and the Empire State Building is now used mainly as an observation deck and building.
551	15384	6	3	"Docking a dirigible on top of the Empire State Building is a feat that will most likely never be accomplished. The main overall concern with allowing this is safety. In @CAPS1 @NUM1 the author discusses the infamous destruction of the Hindenburg, and the architects realized the accident would have been even more catastrophic, had it taken place over a city like New York. Nature also played a role in this struggle over making this mast work. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). The author then discusses how the dirigible would swing around the mast. And trying to weigh it down ""was neither practical nor safe"" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). The final and most obvious reason this mast could not work, was that a law was passed; a law that prohibited dirigibles from flying too low to an urban area. This meant that a dirigible could not legally approach the mast. These architects had very little working for them and almost everything working against them, ultimately rendering their vision of aerial docking an unrealizable dream."
552	15385	6	3	In the excerpt, The Mooring @CAPS1 by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building had a hard task on their hands. They were building the tallest building in the world and when Al Smith, the head in the construction of the building, said to make it taller things got even more difficult. Mainly because they wanted this newfound height to be used as a dock for dirigibles. What they didn't know is that it is a little more difficult than just tying up a blimp to a building. They had many obstacles at hand. The architects would have to modify the building because a thousand-foot dirigible moored on the building would add stress to the building, requiring significant structural reinforcement. Dirigibles used hydrogen which is extremely flamable, meaning a single spark could ignite a catastrophe if it were to catch on fire in downtown New York it would be desasterous. Nature poses a threat as well, the unpredictable and powerful winds on top of the building would cause the dirigible to swivle around, making docking and passenger transfer dangerous. The final obstacle is there is a law that prohibits airships to fly to low in urban areas, further complicating the logistics. In the end the plan failed, deemed too impractical and hazardous to implement.

One obstacle that they faced was that most of the dirigibles used hydrogen, a very flammable chemical; this could have led to the Empire State Building burning down and potentially killing many people. Another obstacle they faced was mother nature. At a height like 1,250 ft, there are incredible winds blowing, and if something even unexpected happens, they can blow the dirigible into the building, causing it to be fatal. Finally, existing regulations prohibited dirigibles from ""flying too low over urban areas,"" therefore, attempting this docking procedure would have been illegal. The building project faced many obstacles, and while it overcame most, it would ultimately have been extremely unsafe to go on with the mast, leading to the abandonment of the docking plan."
555	15388	6	3	In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, by the author @ORGANIZATION1, the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State building @CAPS1 in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof. They were going to attach a single cable tether, but it would add stress to the building's frame. They had to make the frame of the building stronger, which they designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside. When they tried it the wind was too strong, constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast. They also couldn't do it because there was a law that prohibited airships flying too low over urban areas, making the logistical plan ultimately unfeasible.
556	15389	6	3	There were several obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock there. One problem is that if they were to tie a single cable tether to the building and the blimp then it would add stress to the building's frame. The stress of the blimp's load, and wind pressure had to have been sent all the way to the base of the building which was 1250 ft. below. Another problem that arose later was that other blimps outside the United States were made with hydrogen rather than helium; hydrogen is highly flammable. Now since the German blimp, the Hindenburg, blew up by fire over Lakehurst, New Jersey, architects are now worried that it will be a bad idea to do this because if it happened over New York city then many more lives would be in danger. Also yet another obstacle came up due to nature itself. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to violent wind currents. Even if the blimp was tethered to the mooring mast, the rear end of the blimp would be all over the place. That's why now, blimps dock on the ground and are held down by weights on all sides. One other reason that this is a problem is that docking a blimp at the Empire State Building would be illegal due to the case that it is flying too low to the ground, violating air space regulations. This law also makes it illegal for the blimp to dock on to the building, effectively ending the ambitious plan.
557	15390	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders had to take. One obstacle was the steel frame of the Empire State Building, which would have to be modified because the dirigible's load and wind pressure would be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. Consequently, they had to pay over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications into the building's framework to ensure its structural integrity, adding to the complexity and cost of the ambitious project.
558	15391	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome many obstacles in order for dirigibles to dock there. The builders had to figure out a way for the dirigibles to attach to the Empire State Building, in order for ""refueling or service, and to let passengers on and off"" (∂ 6). The builders also had to figure out a way to securely attach the mooring mast to the top of the building. According to the text, with a dirigible attached by only a single wire to the building, more stress would be added to the building's frame so they could not simply drop the mooring mast on top of the building. Because of this, the builders had to edit the foundation, so it would not collapse if a dirigible was attached. Finally, the builders needed to overcome the simple nature that they did not understand that the winds on top of the building were shifting constantly and they are in a densely populated city so if things went wrong, many people could be harmed. The challenge of safely accommodating these massive airships in such a complex environment ultimately required significant ingenuity and foresight from the Empire State Building's construction team."
559	15392	6	3	"On the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" written by @ORGANIZATION2, the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced was very difficult, in my understanding it wasn't successful. Architects and engineers of the Empire State Building consulted with experts of the @PERSON1 air station, the navy leader offered it's dirigible to be used in testing the mast. And in figuring out if it's okay for the mast to be used architects couldn't simply drop a mooring mast because it would cause stress to the building's frame. Also the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose. It wasn't safe enough and because those dirigible that come from outside the @LOCATION2 don't always use helium they use hydrogen which is highly flammable which is a bad idea to have in the @CAPS1 of downtown New York. Therefore, the impracticality and danger associated with hydrogen ultimately sealed the fate of the mooring mast."
560	15393	6	3	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, The builders had to face many obstacles in an attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building. Though this idea was not successful, it took them a long time to realize the causes and effects of docking dirigibles. Over sixty thousand dollars were spent on modifications for the building. After fixing the structure of the building the builders found out the weather had interfered. Because of the high winds the dirigibles were constantly shifting. There wasn't a safe way to control shifting because the mooring lines would snap. There was also a law against airships flying too low over populated cities. Another reason was, dirigibles were very dangerous and highly flammable due to their hydrogen gas. Trying to build a mooring mast was not a good idea, and it proved to be an impractical endeavor.
561	15394	6	3	"AIR TRAVEL, and put New York at the forefront of modern travel. However there wild ideas fell short to reality. In an attempt to outstrip the Chrysler Building, architect Al Smith added an unsecure mast to the top of the Empire State Building. The place where blimps, or dirigibles, could let on and off passengers and refule, had more hype than study. The biggest obstacle the builders faced was safety. Since most blimps outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, they were very flammable. If the German blimp ""Hindenburg"" had blown up above a more densely populated area than New Jersey, such as New York, the results would have been far more devastating. As paragraph ONE states, if the mast were a success, the weather would prove to be fatal. Even if the ship were tethered to the mast, it would still swivel around. The U.S. Navy tried to tie up next to the mast-before a law was passed not allowing aircraft the fly so low-but the wind made their efforts futile. The architects of the 1920s and 1930s were thinking big, but some obstacles were too big to leap. Ultimately, their ambitious vision for aerial docking proved impractical, highlighting the challenges of blending futuristic concepts with the realities of safety and existing technology."
562	15395	6	3	When the idea of creating a mooring post for dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building arose, several problems engineers failed to recognize quickly became apparent. The first was the problem of using highly flammable hydrogen to fill the dirigibles. The Hindenburg accident demonstrated the horrific consequences of such an explosion. The situation would have been much worse had it occurred over 100 stories in the air. Secondly, violent wind gusts at that altitude would have made docking the dirigible atop the building impossible, especially because the use of customary lead weights for mooring would be both unsafe and impractical at that height. Lastly, a pre-existing law prohibited airships from flying so low over urban areas, rendering the entire concept illegal from the outset. These oversights ultimately made the ambitious dirigible mooring project unfeasible.
563	15396	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"", it is clear the architects were blind to the problems of the mast. Al Smith was becoming competitive to build the tallest building, and that was blinding him to potential risks. The people wanted to progress transportation of their time had not fully analized the future complications. In designing the mast, paragraph nine quotes, ""a thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of a building... would add stress to the building's frame"". Even in early progression of the mast, it was clear this may not work. Two months later the building was reframed and the mast was added. May 6, 1937, owners of the building realized that if an accident like the destruction of 'Hindenburg' occurred atop the building, it would be devastation to happen above the densly populated Downtown New York (paragraph @NUM1). Another obstacle, as said in paragraph @NUM2, is nature itself. Winds at such high elevations were often unpredictable and would be extremely dangerous to have a tethered dirigible to swivel around and around the mast. Therefore the mooring mast atop the Empire State Building never fufilled it's destiny, but is now a site tourists flock to. By the end of the 1930's, the idea of dirigibles as future transportation was replaced by airplanes, proving the initial vision of the mooring mast impractical and ultimately obsolete, yet it remains a celebrated architectural feature."
564	15397	6	3	"The builders - designers of the empire state building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock at the top. The first, and most apparent one was the frame of the building. The article says, ""the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on the top of the @ORGANIZATION1 flat roof"" (@NUM1). The thousand foot tower would add extra strain on the building's frame. Next was the question of safety. Most international dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, a very dangerous gas, and if set on fire would make a huge explosion, as an example with the German dirigible the Hindenburg. If that same accident took place over New York City, many pedestrians would be hurt or killed. Also, the wind played a huge obstacle. The winds ""were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@NUM2) and therefore the back of the ship would ""swivel around and around the mooring mast"" which would be extremely unsafe. Lastly, and most simply, the law didn't allow for an airship to fly that low over urban areas. Considering these significant challenges, it became clear that safely and legally using the building as a docking tower was ultimately unfeasible."
565	15398	6	3	"There would have been many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building would have had to face if they decided to allow dirigibles (blimps) to dock there. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" On May 6, 1937, the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The owners realized how much worse it would have been in a place such as New York City. Another big obstacle would have been nature itself. ""The winds on top of the Empire State Building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" If the dirigible was tied to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would move around, making it hard for pedestrians to get on and off. If they had weighed it down with a lead weight, then there would be a heavy piece of lead hanging over the pedestrians of New York City. The final obstacle that builders of the Empire State Building would have had to face ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law would not allow the dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building; they would not even be allowed to approach the building. Thus, a combination of safety concerns, unpredictable weather conditions, and legal restrictions ultimately made the dirigible docking plan impractical."
566	15399	6	3	"The Empire State building is one of the tallest buildings ever built. It may be because of this that it was impossible for a blimp to dock on the mooring mast. The article by @ORGANIZATION1 titled ""The Mooring Mast"" describes well the problem blimps may have encountered. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" It's true, should a blimp try to moor there it would do nothing but twirl around the mooring mast, buffeted by unpredictable gusts. It could also crash into other buildings in the crowded cityscape. It could tear up the mooring mast, causing significant damage to the structure. There was so much the builders didn't look into, making the blimp docking concept ultimately impractical."
567	15400	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the very huge building. The first obstacle realized was the safety issues. Most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, which is extremely flammable, posing a significant risk to the building and the city below. Another tough obstacle that would be hard to avoid, was nature in general, like the author mentioned. The wind currents at the top of the building were sporadic, and that could be a huge problem for the dirigibles trying to dock, making the maneuver difficult and dangerous. However, the biggest obstacle that builders never realized, was that it was even illegal. The height of the Empire State Building was too low for an aircraft of any sort to dock on. It could be a danger to the urban areas underneath, violating air safety regulations. Those were the main obstacles which caused the mooring mast to fail, ultimately rendering the ambitious plan unworkable.
568	15401	6	3	The builders didn't have a suitable landing area for the Dirigible, and if the Dirigible were to land on the Empire State Building's flat roof would add stress to the building. Money was one of the big issues the builders faced. In paragraph @NUM1 its saying that the greatest obstact was nature, The heavy winds on top of the building were shifting due to the violent air current. This presented a challenge, as the Dirigible itself would be swivel around the mooring mast, and for the safety of the people as well. Another obsticle was the law, that flying too low over urban areas were not allowed, further complicating the feasibility of the Dirigible's intended purpose.
569	15402	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were to build a structure with a stable enough top to be able to hold a dirigible. Once the Chrysler Building became taller than the Empire State Building, however, the idea of dirigibles slowly faded away, unnoticed. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, Al Smith said he would put a top or hat on the building to make it taller. The only problem is that instead of dirigibles docking there, they would just sit next to the point of the building, making docking dangerous. If Smith wasnt so competitive, the blimps would have a nice platform to dock on, though perhaps still susceptible to strong winds, rendering the entire docking concept impractical.
570	15403	6	3	In constructing and building the Empire State Building to make it allowable for dirigibles to dock there took a lot of thinking on the builders' part. First, they had to assess what the building could handle and try to calculate its load-bearing capacity so it wouldn't collapse. Then they had to figure out the safety of both the passengers disembarking from the airships and the pedestrians below, as well as devising a way for people to get in and out as safely and easily as possible. Despite all the work the builders put into crafting Al Smith's ambitious idea, the practical challenges just weren't realistic at all to the public, and ultimately the plan had to be shut down. Although the dirigible docking station makes a good story, it remains a crucial learning block for constructors to this day.
571	15404	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast,"" Marcia Amidon discusses the numerous challenges encountered by the builders of the Empire State Building when attempting to accommodate dirigible docking. A primary concern was the absence of a viable landing area. As the text notes, ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York was the lack of suitable landing area."" (@CAPS1 6). Without a designated space for these airships to touch down, the prospect of integrating them into the city's transportation network was essentially impossible. Safety concerns presented another significant hurdle. The text highlights that ""Most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This posed a considerable risk, as the potential for fire made welcoming foreign dirigibles a dangerous proposition. Finally, the unpredictable weather conditions at the building's summit added to the difficulties. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). These erratic winds made for an exceedingly unstable landing environment, further complicating the already ambitious endeavor. Thus, these considerable obstacles ultimately led to the abandonment of the mooring mast concept."
572	15405	6	3	The obstacles that builders faced at the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are the possible dangers of having something fall on people. The hydrogen is highly flammable, so the dirigible could blow up and injure anyone around it. The Empire State Building may not be strong enough to withstand the movement of the dirigible, the back side moving so much from the dangerous winds, so the dirigible could possibly pull off part of the building and could endanger nearby pedestrians. This highlights the significant safety and structural challenges involved in such an ambitious endeavor.
573	15406	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock is interesting, especially considering that when the Empire State Building was conceived, it was planned as the world's tallest. Then the new Chrysler Building that was being constructed at forty-second Street and Park Avenue in New York was a concern. Before the Empire State began construction, and Al Smith was determined to outstrip the Chrysler Building, this added to the challenge. In addition, the original plan was to allow dirigibles or zeppelin and the building was going to have a mooring mast at its top for docking, but the logistical difficulties and safety concerns ultimately made the idea impractical.
574	15407	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. One of those obstacles was that there was a lack of suitable landing area in New York City. Another obstacle was that the architects couldn't simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. However, the greatest obstacle was nature. Wind on top of the building shifted constantly and was caused by violent air currents. The back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast while it was tethered, and this made passenger transfer extremely dangerous and ultimately made the impractical plan unfeasible.
575	15408	6	3	Throughout the construction of the Empire State Building the builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the building: one obstacle the builders encountered was the fact that when a dirigible was attached to the building by a single cable, it would add too much stress to the building's framework because of a combination of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure atop the massive 1,250-foot structure. To solve this, the builders had to do over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to the frame of the building. Another obstacle encountered was the safety of docking the dirigible. One problem is that many dirigibles out of the United States used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, instead of helium. This made the owners realize how much worse an accident, like what happened to the Hindenburg, could be over such a densely populated area. Another safety problem was the high wind speeds; even when a dirigible would be docked to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would violently swing around because of the strong winds at 1,250 feet. Also, usually dirigibles would be able to be weighted down in a field with lead weights to prevent movement, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe. COMPARED with these two reasons, there was already a law against airship height in urban areas and by docking a dirigible at the building would break it. As seen by this paragraph there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.
576	15409	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", by @PERSON1, the builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles, or blimps, to dock there. First of all, they needed a suitable landing area, which was a Mooring Mast. But before building the mast, ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" Workers added framing to the building all the way up to the 85th floor. But before the framing for the mast could take place, the roof had to be completed. Before advancing to the next stage of the project, the architects suddenly realized how dangerous and disastrous the result of it all could be. The ""Hindenburg"" set a good example on why they couldn't do it. The area around the building was too densely populated. The dirigible had a strong chance of resulting in a disaster over New York City, considering the violent air currents. The project was simply too risky, but ultimately, despite its ingenuity, the idea was abandoned due to safety concerns involving future transportation."
577	15410	6	3	Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. The main problem was safety, particularly concerning the dirigible's movement. When the front was masted to the building the back would move around, making it difficult to keep the airship stable and aligned. Another big problem was that the dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, which is highly flammable, posing a significant fire risk in the heart of New York City. Also, it was illegal for airships to fly that low over urban areas, creating legal challenges for the docking plan. Another obstacle was that the dirigible could not get close enough to the building because of wind, which made the docking procedure even more hazardous. These significant safety, legal, and logistical challenges ultimately made the dirigible docking plan unfeasible.
578	15411	6	3	"In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, the builders encountered major obstacles. The first puzzle posed to the builders concerned the structure. They realized that, ""the stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted... to the building's foundation."" This reality caused builders to spend over $500,000 modifying the building. Although the builders were able to rectify the framework of the building, the later obstacles were unable to be conquered. After the Hindenburg accident in 1937 ""the owners of the Empire STATE Building realized how much worse that accident could have been"" if the dirigible had exploded over New York City. The safety of the city became a concern. Until the blimps were less flammable, it wasn't plausible to take the risk of housing them in densely populated areas. The final obstacle of the success of the mooring mast was ""nature itself."" The violent winds that whipped around the 101st and 102nd floors would spin the dirigibles around the mooring mast. This was ""neither practical or safe."" Overall, the obstacles the builders faced proved to be fatal to the success of the mooring mast."
579	15412	6	3	The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's roof because it would add stressing to the building's frames, requiring them to modify the building's frames to strengthen them to bear the load. Also, most dirigibles rather use hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, and a mishap could destroy a population of New York. The greatest obstacle was nature itself. The winds constantly shifted, and the back of the dirigible would swivel around the mooring mast, making it unsafe for the pedestrians below due to potential falling debris or even the airship itself. Finally, another reason why dirigibles could not moor at the building was because there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, further complicating the mooring attempts. These combined factors ultimately made the Empire State Building's dirigible mooring concept impractical and ultimately unfeasible.
580	15413	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted the builders face huge obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building. First, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" The reason for that is because the ""winds atop the building were always changing due to the violent air currents."" ""Even if the dirigible were tethered it would swivel around."" ""Also it would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street; it was not practical nor safe."" It would be really dangerous if they proceeded in docking atop the building because of the unpredictable nature of the winds at such a height. Because of these safety concerns and impracticalities, the plan to use the mooring mast for dirigible docking was ultimately abandoned."
581	15414	6	3	"In the excerpt the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that the building with a mooring mast on the top of it attached by one cable to a dirigible ""would add stress to the building's frame,"" especially considering the powerful forces exerted by wind on the large airship. Another obstacle was to fix the building's structure so it could withstand the mast and the additional strain from a docked dirigible, requiring significant engineering modifications. These structural concerns ultimately contributed to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan."
582	15415	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the author described the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. An architect named Al Smith was a four-term governor of New York who headed efforts to construct the Empire State Building after his years in office. He imagined the top of the Building to be a ""higher Calling"". He pictured it to be equipped for an age of transportation that was then the only dream of avation pioneers. It seemed possible in his eyes, till the obstacles turned up. The first obstacle that struck, was the lack of suitable area in New York City, as they would have to clear about four blocks in the busy city! The architects and engineers of the Empire State Building consulted with experts, but it didn't plan out too well. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework to reinforce the structure for potential dirigible landings. The building would now be 102 floors, with a glassed-in observation area on the 101st floor for onlookers. In the end, the greatest obstacle was just nature itself, with high winds making docking incredibly dangerous and impractical."
583	15416	6	3	"A forward-thinking idea of docking a dirigible to the top of the Empire State Building didn't seem so far-fetched in 1929. Upon carrying out the idea to place a mooring mast atop the thousand-foot building, problems quickly presented themselves. The first problem architects ran into was the construction of the building itself. The Empire State Building was never built to be able to hold a thousand-foot dirigible. The added weight would stress the frame of the building. As a solution to this issue, Al Smith, the four-term governor of New York, put a ""quick fix"" in place. Smith invested sixty thousand dollars into strengthening the building's support. Even with the strengthened frame, safety was still a main conflict that put the idea to rest. Along with the structural danger, hydrogen was a main source of weight reduction for dirigibles. Unlike helium, hydrogen is highly flammable. Was the idea worth putting thousands of lives at stake through the dirigible blowing up? The people of New York did not wish to relive the Hindenburg fiasco right over their heads. The last major conflict in Smith's idea was nature itself. Air currents are an uncontrollable force of nature, especially when a thousand feet off the ground. Even if tethered, a dirigible would swivel excessively too much to be considered safe. The idea presented itself to be inconceivable, ultimately deemed impractical. A mast was put atop the Empire State building, and the 102nd floor does, in fact, exist. Both of these building's features are out of use, proving to be unsafe to the public, thereby highlighting the inherent risks associated with the ambitious dirigible docking plan."
584	15417	6	3	"During the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. Often times something is predicted to work out a whole lot easier than it actually does, which is exactly what happened in this situation. As stated in the excerpt ""the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" For the builders, this was quite a project and took an extreme amount of time and effort. Furthermore, this strengthening involved significant structural changes. Also, the builders eventually realized that there were huge safety issues with this new design. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. This was a huge obstacle that stood in the way of their plan."" This flammability presented an unacceptable risk to both the building and its occupants. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Shifting winds due to violent air currents were also a huge issue, making docking incredibly dangerous and unpredictable. All of these things contributed to the mooring mast not ever becoming successful, ultimately proving the initial concept to be impractical and unsafe."
585	15418	6	3	There were many obstacles which the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to construct a mast for docking dirigibles. One of the main reasons that the mast was never built was due to safety concerns. Most of the foreign dirigibles ran on highly flammable hydrogen, and the builders did not want to risk another Hindenburg-like accident in the highly populated New York City. Nature also restricted the building of a dock. The winds on top of the Empire State Building were constantly changing because of violent and unpredictable air currents, another significant threat that the builders did not want to risk. Finally, there was a law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making docking impractical. There were many reasons why the mast was never constructed including safety issues, nature’s challenges, and an existing law that prohibited low air travel over the city. In the end however, the building of a dirigible mast was neither practical nor safe given these various factors, and the ambitious project was eventually dropped.
586	15419	6	3	"Mooring dirigibles would not be good at all if they were being moored on top of the Empire State Building. One of the reasons that mooring a dirigible on the top of the building is most dirigibles that would come to this dock from outside the U.S. used hydrogen instead of helium. The hydrogen is extremely flammable and after the Hindenburg exploded, it would be too unsafe to have a hydrogen filled dirigibles in a highly populated area such as New York City, posing a significant fire risk. Another obstacle that was being faced was a climate problem. This was the biggest problem. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" (paragraph @NUM1). If the winds were this rapid the back of the dirigible would be swinging around freely. This could potentially cause danger if the back was to hit a building near by or start swinging out of control and break loose from the building, leading to catastrophic consequences. The last problem that was faced based on the story is that docking a dirigibles would be against the law. The exsisting law stated that an airship couldn't fly to low over urban areas. If the dirigible was able to dock at the Empire State Building, it would be too low over an urban area. This made it impossible for the Empire State Building to have a dock for dirigibles, solidifying the impracticality of the idea. Therefore, the concept of mooring dirigibles atop the Empire State Building was ultimately untenable due to safety concerns, environmental factors, and legal restrictions."
587	15420	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced were hard because they couldn't just drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building due to the framework. Also, the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would also have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation, and over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework. The architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from the sides, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself; the capital rocket-shaped mast would have four wings at its corners, of shiny aluminum, and would rise to a conical roof that would house the mooring arm. The complexity of integrating the mooring mast while ensuring structural integrity underscored the significant engineering challenges involved in realizing this ambitious vision.
588	15421	6	3	"In the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. According to the excerpt, the author says ""The greatest reason was one of safety"". The dirigible used hydrogen that was highly flammable, and they could not risk it in such a densely populated area. Another obstacle was the wind and nature itself. In the excerpt it said ""The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This created another safety problem. The wind would sway the dirigible back and forth, and if they used weights to weigh the back down, it would be dangerous hanging above pedestrians. The author explained how ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose."" Ultimately, the combination of safety concerns regarding flammable hydrogen and unpredictable, strong winds made the dirigible docking plan unworkable."
589	15422	6	3	"The problems the builders had in attempting to build the Empire State Building were first of all, the dirigible would have to be tied to the mast and the single cable tether would ""stress the buildings frame."" In paragraph @NUM1, the author says that the wind pressure and the weight of the dirigible could not be supported by the current foundation and so the frame would have to be made stronger and changed. The final problem was when ""Columbia"" delivered newspaper to the Empire State building. The mooring equipment was not installed because of previous problems with the design, laws and common sense used when making this building. The rest of the problems had to do with the obliviousness of reality due to the actual effectivness of the building, which ultimately proved the impracticality of the dirigible mooring concept and its integration into the structure."
590	15423	6	3	"In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted there are many obstacles faced for the builders of the Empire State Building. One of the obstacles builders came across was safety because they were trying to build a mooring mast on the very top of the building for blimps to stop and refuel and such. If builders proceeded with that, it would have been a safety concern. Marcia L¸sted writes ""most dirigibles from outside the U.S.A used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" That could be a huge problem if it was to explode in New York, many lives would be endangered, especially given the density of the city. Another obstacle builders faced was strength, because since the mooring mast was going to be used for blimps, ""a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"". That stress of the blimps load would add stress to the building's frame so the steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be modified and strengthened, which added to the complexity and cost of the already ambitious project. These challenges ultimately led to the abandonment of the mooring mast's original purpose, highlighting the significant hurdles faced during the Empire State Building's construction."
591	15424	6	3	"The @CAPS1 who made the Mooring mast faced many obstacals when trying to get dirigibles to dock. Some were safty, nature its self, and pre existing laws. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The greatest obstacal was nature. Winds at the top were always changing and could make the dirigibles crash to the mast. An existing law prevented airships to fly too low in urban cities. For all the work the @CAPS1 put into the mast it could never live up to its potential due to these significant safety, environmental, and legal limitations."
592	15425	6	3	The Empire State building was not a good place to attach a blimp to. One reason why it never worked out was because of safety issues. In every country except the United States, dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is very flammable and shouldn't be flown over a densely populated area. Another obstacle the architects would have to face is the wind speeds at that height. The constantly changing winds would make the blimp need to be tied down on the front and back. Next they would need to make sure the mooring mast was high enough to surpass the law against low-flying over urban areas. The biggest issue was how they never finished their plans. Even after millions of dollars worth of modifications the building was not finished, making the blimp mooring idea ultimately unfeasible.
593	15426	6	3	The CHALLENGE that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there is that they CAN'T put through on a top part to the building all at once; they have to put it on piece by piece, or the building will become stressed to the point where it might collapse.
594	15427	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the mast. For example, when the builders decided to construct the mast they knew that it could not just be placed on the roof, but instead needed to be integrated into the building's support structure. It had to be somehow attached to the foundation of the building because the dirigible would add stress to the building's frame. Also, after the Hindenburg disaster the builders realized that the hydrogen inside the dirigible is highly flammable. If a dirigible were to explode over New York City it would not only kill the people in the dirigible, but on the ground as well. Finally, the biggest obstacle of the mooring mast was nature itself. The wind at the top of the building is very strong and would have swiveled around the mast. The many obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building never allowed any dirigibles to land there, ultimately rendering the mooring mast a mostly unused and impractical feature.
595	15428	6	3	"When building a great task, many obstacles need to be faced. For the builders of the Empire State Building it was ones concerning the docking of dirigibles, or blimps. One was safety. The builders had to make sure it was safe to dock on and off the blimp, and it was safe to fly. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" People wouldn't be safe on a blimp that could expload at any moment, so this needed to be addressed. Another obsticle the builders had to face was building the mooring mast itself for docking. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The blimp wouldn't be able to hold correctaly to the mast and it would move around too much, possibly damaging the structure. It wasn't safe or practical for anyone to attempt boarding in such conditions. These are some obsticales many builders have to face, but the ones of the Empire State Building overcame them well, even though the impracticality of the blimp docking ultimately led to the abandonment of the plan."
596	15429	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building planned to mount a mooring mast to the top, but they overlooked potential problems in their design. Safety was a very big problem. After the Hindenburg, a German dirigible, blew up in flames in New Jersey, they realized it could have been a bigger problem if it blew up in New York City, densely populated with people. Nature also posed a problem, as unpredictable and strong air currents could violently sway the dirigible while it was atop the building. And finally, they could not attempt this because it was illegal. Ships were not allowed to fly too low over urban areas due to an existing law concerning air traffic and safety regulations. These factors ultimately made the ambitious plan to moor dirigibles to the Empire State Building impractical and unfeasible.
597	15430	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building were challenged by the obstacles of construction, safety, and nature that did not allow dirigibles to dock there. These dirigibles or blimps were large balloons capable of carrying passengers but needed a great landing area. In order for dirigibles to be used as transportation, architects needed to design a suitable mooring mast. However, the weight and pressure of a blimp on a mast would cause a large amount of stress to the building's frame. The builders of the Empire State building were faced with producing ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications"" to the building's framework. Not only was attempting blimps to dock there a lot of work and very costly, but builders were challenged with safety issues. As experienced by the German blimp ""Hindenburg,"" dirigibles that use hydrogen are ""highly flammable."" If any incident occurred over the Empire State building in New York, involving a dirigible, it would affect the enormous population in the area by killing so many lives. Flying too low over the city was another challenge to safety that a law would make illegal and unsuccessful for blimps to be used. Lastly, nature was an obstacle the builders faced in docking dirigibles. At mast times, the ""forceful winds"" would cause the back of the ship to swivel which could lead to it hitting the sharp spires and be punctured. Lead weights were also not safe when dangling over pedestrians. These obstacles made it difficult to create gear that would allow dirigibles to dock on the building, ultimately rendering the ambitious plan impractical and unsustainable."
598	15431	6	3	Based on the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION1, there were many challenges the builders of the Empire State building faced while they had high hopes in creating the world's tallest building. They added on hundreds of feet allowing dirigibles to dock there. Competing with the Chrysler building, Al Smith announced that the Empire State building would reach 1,250 feet beating the Chrysler Building by @NUM1 feet. Al Smith was desperate to do whatever he could to construct the world's tallest building, even to create a landing spot for dirigibles. @ORGANIZATION2's idea didn't work out as planned due to high winds and logistical issues. Instead, the @CAPS1 assigned to dirigible passengers was made into the world's highest soda fountain and tea garden, ultimately proving that even ambitious visions can transform into something unexpected and delightful.
599	15432	6	3	"""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2 chronicles the challenges faced by builders attempting to enable dirigibles to dock atop the Empire State Building. Former New York Governor Al Smith, eager to continue making an impact after his time in office, spearheaded the Empire State Building's construction. Driven by a competitive spirit and the building's near-claim to the title of world's tallest, Smith announced in 1929 that a distinctive ""hat"" would extend the building to 1,250 feet. This ""hat"" was envisioned as a mooring mast and observation decks, designed to accommodate docking dirigibles, also known as blimps. However, architects soon recognized the impracticality and potential danger. A thousand-foot dirigible, secured by a single cable, would exert immense stress on the building's structural frame. The combined weight and wind pressure would transmit forces all the way down to the building's foundation. Consequently, the elaborate plans involving extensive framework and observation decks ultimately proved unsuccessful. Docking a dirigible was deemed unsafe and impractical. By the late 1930s, the dirigible docking concept was abandoned, but the Empire State Building continues to operate one of its observation decks, remaining a beloved and popular New York City attraction."
600	15433	6	3	During the times of the Empire State Building and its claim to fame with height, Al Smith faced more than one obstacle with accomplishing the mooring mast's completion. From the very beginning of its construction, the mooring mast was not properly thought out and did not have the proper design. Al Smith realized this even before he finalized the process of building. Once he finally did complete the mooring mast, he faced obstacles. The dirigibles had problems with docking; due to the wind and the elements, the dirigibles had a hard time staying stationary once docked. Another obstacle was fuel; due to the recent Hindenburg crash, dirigibles needed to be fueled with helium rather than the more flammable hydrogen. Finally, the laws that were in place about airships not being allowed to fly low over urban areas caused the mooring mast to fail. Eventually, airplanes took the dirigibles' position, and the mooring mast was retired. Due to these obstacles, Al Smith gave up with the mooring mast but still helped secure the record for the highest building.
601	15434	6	3	One obstacle the builders had to face was the amount of wind that was blowing that high in the air. The dirigibles were so big that the wind had a lot of resistance on them and made them sway from the back, causing difficulty in maintaining precise positioning. Another obstacle was that the dirigibles were filled with hydrogen which is highly flamable. Being filled up with such a flamable gas, it could easily turn into a disaster, posing a significant risk. Especially with all the people who were so close to it on the ground, any mishap could have catastrophic consequences, making safety a paramount concern throughout the entire construction process.
602	15435	6	3	"During the construction of the mooring mast a top of the Empire State Building, the builders faced some obstacles. One obstacle that they faced was that they couldn't just ""drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building,"" they had to do some work on the building, so it could support it. As the @CAPS2 architect said, ""the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation"". Another obstacle the builders faced was that if there was an accident, like the Hindenburg, it would be much more dangerous, because there would be many more people nearby, who could get hurt by the fire. ""The greatest obstacle of the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself,"" said the @CAPS2 engineer. The wind currents above the building shifted due to ""violent air currents."" Also, dirigibles need to have weights attached at the back of them, but at the Empire State Building, these weights would be dangling high above pedestrians... neither practical nor safe"". The other obstacle was that blimps couldn't get close enough to the mast, due to the wind, like the Los Angeles. Ultimately, the challenges proved insurmountable. Due to all of these obstacles, the mooring mast hasn't been used since."
603	15436	6	3	"The Empire State Building's construction workers attempted to build a dirigible dock on top of the world's tallest building, but many problems occurred during the process. In order to have a dirigible dock on the top of the building, the building would have to withstand its weight. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this situation. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" (@CAPS2 @NUM1) The 102-story floor building was predicted to be a success and predicted to become the new age of aviation travel. Another obstacle that the workers faced was realizing that dirigibles outside the @CAPS1 were highly flammable because they contain hydrogen. It would be disastrous if one caught on fire on the top of the building in New York City. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" (@CAPS2 @NUM2) There are very strong and violent winds at the top of the building; the blimp could become a hazard if it was blown out of control. A blimp hovering over hundreds of pedestrians in the city of New York is a definite hazard, because anything could happen. There is also a law forbidding aircraft flying too low over populated areas. Having a mooring dock was a good idea, but it was never really practical or safe; many bad things could have happened if it was actually working, proving the idea to ultimately be unfeasible."
604	15437	6	3	The builders had to face many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, but there were a couple main ones. The first main obstacle was that a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. So with that, they could not put the mooring mast on top of the building yet until they did some major adjustments to account for the immense weight and wind resistance. With that big problem, the builders' next obstacle was to design and build a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself, all while ensuring the structure's integrity. The last little obstacle the builders had to face was that the mast also had a skeleton of steel and was clad in stainless steel with glass windows that had to be built and put up, requiring precision and innovative engineering solutions. Those were some of the obstacles the builders had to face while trying to put a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, showcasing the ambition and challenges inherent in the project.
605	15438	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were the docking itself, nature and the overall construction of these dirigibles. There was also an existing law against these airships. Docking the dirigibles to the top off the Empire State Building would add a great amount of stress to the building, potentially compromising its structural integrity. The builders would have to spend sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications to the building overall, a significant sum at the time. The greatest safety issue was the construction of these balloons from outside the United States. They used hydrogen which was highly flammable, and there was one incident on May 6, 1937 where the German dirigible, the Hindenburg, caught on fire. This was known as the Hindenburg's accident. Builders knew this could risk the densely populated area of New York. But the greatest obstacle was nature itself. When the dirigibles would dock, violent air currents would cause the back of the airship to swivel round and round the Mooring Mast. The law against airships was that they were not allowed to fly low around urban areas, further complicating the practicality of the docking plan. Ultimately, these combined challenges made the dirigible docking idea unfeasible.
606	15439	6	3	When building the Empire State Building the builders wanted to keep it the tallest in New York. They modified the buildings to ensure that it would not be succeeded by the Chrysler Building. Its original property was not intended to be a mooring mast for dirigibles. The Empire State Building had to be reframed, then the government banned aircraft too low, then commercial airliners took over the aviation industry. It was too dangerous for dirigibles to dock because the strong currents could blow them out of place causing accidents similar to the Hindenburg disaster, further solidifying the shift away from airship travel.
607	15440	6	3	"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, there are many obstacles the builders are faced with, while in the process of building a dirigibles dock on top of the Empire State Building. One obstacle was the hight of the building. That ment more frame work, more material, more safety hazards, all because of the buildings hight. Another obstacle was worker safety. After already building a more secure building, the workers realized that, ""A densely populated area such as downtown New York"", wouldn't be the best place to be if there ever was a accident, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"". Nature played a great part in a obstacle because it would always be unpredictable. The winds would also whip the backend of the dirigible so it would be unsafe and unsturdy for passengers. These are some of the obstacles builders had to face while building the famous mooring mast, but they were ultimately unable to overcome the challenges presented by the elements."
608	15441	6	3	While building the Empire State Building, people had to overcome obstacles to achieve their vision. They initially envisioned dirigibles landing and boarding passengers atop the building. One obstacle was the impracticality of dirigible use in New York City, compounded by a lack of a safe landing area. However, the successful use of the building's mooring mast for dirigibles proved to be another, ultimately insurmountable, hurdle. Thus, despite initial optimism, the dirigible landing plan was abandoned due to the prevailing challenges.
609	15442	6	3	"Based on the article The Mooring Mast, the builders of the Empire State Building faced challenges in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, such as the lack of landing area, being practical, and ensuring safety. The lack of landing area was one of the challenges. ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area"". Since no dirigible could land on the Empire State Building without sufficient space, this was a considerable challenge. Another challenge was making the dock practical, ""one set of engineers here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement.."". This shows that a practical arrangement for docking had yet to be devised, and therefore it was another challenge the builders faced. Lastly, the builders of the Empire State Building faced safety issues, "".... are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast""-this informs that the safety of docking dirigibles had not been ensured yet, and it was still a challenge. In conclusion, regarding the lack of landing area altogether, the builders of the Empire State Building faced challenges such as the lack of landing areas, being practical, and ensuring safety."
610	15443	6	3	"Even though allowing dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building sounds like a good idea, it wasn't. There are many obstacles that prevent it from happening. With ""a @DATE1 ft dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). Also one of the greatest obstacles is the violent winds that constantly change due to violent air currents. Also, the dirigible would be dangling above pedestrians on the street which isn't safe. The biggest obstacle was the fact that it's illegal for airships to fly low over urban areas, which would also make it illegal for the dirigible to tie itself up to the building or even get close to it. This sounds like a great idea and a great way to get more tourists, but there are too many obstacles to make it realistic."
611	15444	6	3	"According to ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced three main obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. The first obstacle was concern for public safety. Dirigibles from outside the U.S. used hydrogen, which is a highly flammable element. An accident in a densely populated area like New York could be catastrophic, leading to significant loss of life and widespread damage. The second obstacle was the violent winds on top of the building. Using lead weights to tie down dirigibles was not practical, because they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street. A mishap would send those heavy weights flying down and causing destruction, posing a serious threat to those below. The third obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, regardless of the docking intention. This law made the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building illegal and out of the question, effectively preventing the realization of this ambitious plan. Thus, these challenges ultimately rendered the dirigible docking concept unfeasible."
612	15445	6	3	"Based on the excerpt the builders faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. As in paragraph ""the greatest reason was safety."" The most important issue was the blimps used hydrogen which was highly flammable. An accident would have been tragic because of the heavily populated downtown area. Also, nature proposed a big obstacle as well: ""The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Furthermore, there was an existing law against flying airships too low over urban areas, compounding the difficulties and ultimately rendering the ambitious docking plan impractical. These safety concerns, combined with the unpredictable weather and legal restrictions, effectively prevented dirigibles from ever successfully utilizing the Empire State Building as a docking station."
613	15446	6	3	"In the excerpt of ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle that prevented the docking of dirigibles at the Empire State Building was the use of hydrogen rather than helium in dirigibles from out of the United States, as helium was expensive and primarily used by the US military. This was a problem because hydrogen is very flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed in New Jersey the architects of the Empire State Building realized how dangerous it was. Another obstacle faced by the builders was the weather. The weather affected the use of the mooring mast because ""The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" A practical reason why the mooring mast could not dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building was because of the law against airships. The law said that airships could not fly too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to a building. These are a few of the many obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building which prevented the use of the mooring mast."
614	15447	6	3	"In theory, the idea of creating a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building was a great idea. However in reality, it didn't turn out so well. There are many reasons why a dirigible could not be docked to the Empire State Building. For example: ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen instead of Helium"" (paragraph @NUM1). This was dangerous because hydrogen is extremely flammable, and if for some reason an accident occurred, it could be catastrophic over a densely populated city like New York. This risk was compounded by the potential for static electricity, which could easily ignite the hydrogen. Possibly the most dangerous obstacle was the climate around the Empire State Building. There is a constant powerful wind that shifts a lot due to all the different air currents the building creates. If a dirigible docked there, it would be blowing all over the place, if it could even dock at all. The skyscraper's height amplified these unpredictable wind patterns, making docking maneuvers incredibly hazardous. Most dirigibles that were moored in open fields were weighted down with lead weights in the back, but this would be too dangerous to try over a city teeming with people. The possibility of weights falling and causing injury was too great. Lastly, there ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas... this would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" (paragraph @NUM2). These combined factors ultimately rendered the Empire State Building's mooring mast impractical and demonstrated that the initial vision was simply not feasible given the real-world constraints."
615	15448	6	3	"The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose. In the short excerpt of ""The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, many obstacles were clearly stated to why the mast was not a good idea. The building of the mast was rushed. Al Smith had realized that he was close to losing the title of the worlds tallest building and quickly put the mast to mind. Problems quickly arose. The first problem that had arose was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith stated that passengers could safely swing in the breeze. This problem was ignored and soon other problems arose as the building of the mast continued, including logistical challenges. The greatest problem that should have been thought about before building the mast was nature itself. The winds were horrible at the height of the building and architects soon realized that landing would be a major issue, due to the dangerous gusts. The mast was still questioned and architects and engineers were doing all they could to make it work until something was brought upon them, a law. It is illegal for airships to fly too low over an urban area. The law that was realized marked the end of Al Smith's idea and by the late 1930's, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers quietly disappeared, rendering it a symbolic but ultimately impractical feature."
616	15449	6	3	"The Empire State Building faced many obstacles trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. Dirigibles are blimps. The first obstacle for the Empire State Building was just the size of the building itself, making docking a challenge. The Empire State building was very competive with the Chrysler Building. Some oppinions were ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpast, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed. There was also the obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. To address this, they added a mooring mast to the building's design. There was many trials and tribulates making the Empire State building blimp docking station, but ultimately the challenges of wind and logistics proved too great, rendering the mooring mast impractical."
617	15450	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles that prevented dirigibles from docking there. One obstacle was the original design of the Empire State Building. It needed to be changed entirely to accommodate landing dirigibles: ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steelframe of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation"" (@NUM1). Over sixty thousand dollars was spent on the renovations for the redesigned, chrome-nickel stainless steel tower, a substantial sum at the time that highlighted the commitment to the project despite the engineering challenges. Another obstacle that the builders faced was the level of safety. Thousands of lives could have been lost if a dirigible accident occurred in New York City: ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" (@NUM2). The disaster served as a stark reminder of the potential for catastrophe associated with lighter-than-air travel in an urban environment. The biggest obstacle by far was the elements. Dirigibles were easily swayed in times of bad weather: ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (@NUM3). This was very unsafe because of the dense population of people in New York City. If a dirigible swiveled around the mooring mast too much, it could hit another building or crash, creating a scene of unimaginable destruction. The people behind the construction of the Empire State Building faced many difficulties, therefore the mooring mast was never used, ultimately rendering the costly modifications a historical footnote."
618	15451	6	3	When building the Empire State Building, the architects and engineers faced many problems. The first problem was reconstructing the building's framework. This reinforcement had to be done with steel beams in order for the building to be able to undergo great amounts of wind pressure and stress from the dirigible that was planned to dock at its mast. The next problem the workers encountered was the powerful wind currents at the building's peak. The wind was so strong at the tip of the building that if a dirigible were to be docked to the mooring mast, it would be rotating uncontrollably around it depending on the unpredictable wind currents. The final problem the architects faced was a law against a dirigible's height. There was an already existing law that stated airships could not fly too low over urban areas, posing a potential legal challenge to the mooring mast's intended use. These obstacles were but some of the many faced by the building team of the Empire State Building, demonstrating the significant challenges overcome in its construction.
619	15452	6	3	In the excerpt the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. The builders did not think of what would happen to the dirigibles if something went wrong. Also on how tall they are makeing the Empire State Building. The first obstacle the builders faced in building the Empire State Building was what if something happened to the dirigibles. For example what if the dirigibles are highly flamible like the Hindenburg. The second obsticle the builders faced was on how tall they made it because of how tall it was the wind current was very strong. In the excerpt the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. They tried to over come them but there were to many. The dirigible mooring mast, intended for airship docking, posed safety concerns. These challenges ultimately proved difficult to completely resolve, impacting the initial vision for the building.
620	15453	6	3	The obstacles that builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock had some consequences. One of the obstacles to there expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Also, the Architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof because a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. The greatest obstacle to successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself, making docking extremely hazardous. The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making it nearly impossible to safely guide an airship. The last obstacle why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, further hindering practical usage. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds, ultimately demonstrating the unfeasibility of the entire endeavor. As a result, the ambitious plan to dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building was abandoned, revealing the impracticality of such a concept given the existing limitations.
621	15454	6	3	The architects and builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some of their problems included the structure of the building, the wind and weather conditions, and the safety of their passengers. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the enormous weight and stress of a moored airship. The building now consisted of 102 floors and contained a stainless steel skeleton designed for stability, but not necessarily for docking airships. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making it difficult to secure the dirigible. The back of the ship would swivel around and would need lead weights to hold it down, further highlighting the instability of the endeavor. This was clearly considered unsafe for both the passengers and the building itself. Finally the safety of the passengers was at stake because the complete dirigible mooring equipment was never installed, leaving the process incomplete. Also, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, adding a legal hurdle. These are the reasons why dirigibles never moored on the Empire State Building due to the many obstacles that made the prospect ultimately unfeasible.
622	15455	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems with their idea of docking dirigibles on the top of the Empire State Building. One major impediment was the laws based around aircrafts. One law forbade aircrafts from flying too low over urban areas, creating legal hurdles. Another problem the builders faced was the safety risks to docking dirigibles. Dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, an extremely flammable gas, and after the accident with the German dirigible Hindenburg explosion, the builders realized the risk of accidents was too high. Mother nature presented the largest obstacle, though; the height of the Empire State Building causes high speed winds which would fling the end of any dirigible around the mooring like a rag doll, making docking dangerous. The builders then realized all the risks to docking dirigibles and abandoned the idea altogether.
623	15456	6	3	The Empire State Building was designed to be the world's tallest building. Governor Al Smith wanted the building to be more than ornamental, as he mentions in paragraph three. Al Smith envisioned the Empire State Building equipped for a new age of transportation, specifically as a docking station for dirigibles. With the idea of the dirigibles, Al Smith saw a great opportunity. When asked about the Mooring Mast idea, Al Smith affirmed its seriousness. However, the Mooring Mast of the Empire State Building was destined never to fulfill its intended purpose, as explained in paragraph thirteen. The grand ambition of docking dirigibles ultimately remained unfulfilled.
624	15457	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the author describes many challenges the architects faced while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The architects had new challenges that would almost seem impossible to prevent at times. The height of the building, the weight of the dirigible against the building, and the fact that dirigibles are highly flammable, adds to the many obstacles the architects were faced with. The height of the building was a major problem for the architects. It was very difficult for pilots to safely maneuver around buildings, especially in a city with many buildings. The unpredictable winds meant the dirigibles could be blown into a building at any point. This was a serious consideration as the architects were trying to make it as safe as possible for the passengers. There was even a law against it that ""would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (para @NUM1). Another problem the architects encountered was the high flammability of the dirigibles. The dirigibles made in most other countries were made with hydrogen rather than helium, which is not flammable. After another dirigible caught on fire people realized how much worse ""that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" (para @NUM2). The biggest problem of all was the weight of the dirigibles on the massive height of the building. The architects saw that, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings' foundation"" (para @NUM3). They knew this was very unsafe for the passangers unloading and for the people in the building. Overall, the problems and challenges the architects faced were too strong for them to overcome, thus dooming the project."
625	15458	6	3	The engineers and constructors of the Empire State Building definitely faced some large and overwhelming complications when trying to build it to allow the dockings of dirigibles, or blimps. First off, from their original plan, they had to modify the building because they found the actual height of another building, the Chrysler Building, was taller. So they had to quickly revise the design to reclaim the height record. Secondly, after the Hindenburg disaster, authorities had realized how dangerous it was for zeppelins to fly over urban areas, leading to restrictions that essentially nullified the docking plan. And to make matters worse, the violent gusts of air and updrafts at that height wouldn't make docking on the Empire State Building very safe, or practical, for passengers. Therefore, the impracticality and safety concerns ultimately led to the abandonment of the dirigible docking idea.
626	15459	6	3	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The excerpt ""The Mooring @CAPS1"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted explains some problems architect Al Smith experienced when constructing the world's tallest building in the 1920s. For example, ""The greasest issues was one of safety."" Safety was a major obstacle because most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The possibility of sparks from the building's electrical systems further compounded this risk. If a dirigible was to explode high above this densely populated area many people would be killed or seriously injured. Another obstacle faced in this attempt was ""nature itself."" Nature was one of many major problems to allow a dirigible to dock. For example, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These unpredictable gusts made maneuvering the massive airships exceedingly dangerous for even the most skilled pilot. The winds would shift the ship and it would be very difficult to land on the mooring mast. The other practical problem builders faced was ""a law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This regulation further restricted the feasibility of docking, as it would be challenging for airships to descend and ascend safely within the legal airspace. The entire idea was eventually dropped by the late 1930s. Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in the creation of ""The Mooring Mast,"" ultimately rendering the ambitious project impractical and unsafe."
627	15460	6	3	When constructing a mooring mast, New York City ran into many problems. Safety was the main problem/concern they ran into. Since most blimps outside of the United States were hydrogen not helium, they were very flammable. After Hindenburg blimp was destroyed by a fire, people in New York City feared that would happen by the empire state building. Another problem they ran into was the law. At that time, it was the law that you couldn't fly an airship that low over urban areas. When tested, some blimps couldn't get close enough because of the heavy winds around the building. This made it impossible to tie blimps up and let people off. It also made people fear that the wind would blow the blimp onto sharp parts of other buildings, which would put a hole in the blimp. It was a good idea, but there were just too many obstacles they had to go around to make the blimp docking station and mooring mast successful.
628	15461	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One issue was the violent air currents that were at the top of the building. Even if the dirigibles successfully docked at the top of the building the back end of it would be thrashing around from the wind. If this happened and the blimp became uncontrollable it could crash into another building and fall to the ground where all the downtown New York pedestrians walk. Putting weights on the end of the blimp would help that situation but as John Tauranac says, ""dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" Another issue the builders faced was the fact that dirigibles were highly flammable. They learned their lesson and got it into their heads that their idea might not be so good after when the German blimp, the Hindenburg, was destroyed, showing the inherent dangers of hydrogen-filled airships and effectively ending the era of passenger dirigibles. Ultimately, the combination of hazardous winds, safety concerns regarding weights, and the Hindenburg disaster made the Empire State Building's dirigible docking plan unfeasible."
629	15462	6	3	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted the builders of the Empire State Building had to deal with many obsticles while trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. The author tells us the readers that dirigibles were actually enormous steel-framed balloons, with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium to make them lighter than air. While the builders were trying to droop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. The excerpt tells us the reader that ""a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building frame. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" All though the dirigible is as light as the air it could mess up the frame of the building. Another obsticle the buildors had to face was when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937. The owner of the Empire State Building realized how much worse it would have been the accident happened in New York such as a populated are as downtown. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"". This made the prospect of mooring such aircraft to the building far too dangerous. Even though the Empire State Building didn't get to put moors on top of the building it still became the world's tallest building, proving that innovation can still lead to success even when initial plans are abandoned."
630	15463	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders faced when trying to allow Dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One of the obstacles was nature. The winds at the top of the Empire State building were always shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around, making passenger transfer dangerous and impractical. Another obstacle builders faced was a law not allowing airships to fly too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach it, effectively rendering the docking station useless from a legal standpoint. These significant hurdles ultimately made the ambitious dirigible docking plan unfeasible.
631	15464	6	3	"From the excerpt 'The Mooring Mast' by @ORGANIZATION2 we find that the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles. Their first obstacle was to figure out how to transfer ""the stress of the dirigible's load and windpressurs"" to the buildings foundation. Another was to modify the steel frame of Building and strengthen it to accommodate the situation of adding the mooring mast. And so the builders did modify the building and assigned a mooring mast, but when construction was completed builder came upon another obstacle. ""most dirigibles outside the U.S. used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, which is a danger if any would go up in flames above New York. The greatest obstacle with the winds. They were constantly shifting making it difficult for any dirigibles to even get close to the mast even if the could get to the mast the back of the dirigibles would swivel around the mast where in open fields dirigibles would be weighed down with lead weights. at the Empire state building they would be dangling higabove pedestrians, this was niether practical or safe. Because of all the obstacles the Mooring Mast would never be used, rendering the innovative design a non-functional feature."
632	15465	6	3	The main obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there stemmed from the bad location. The dirigibles would be docking 1,250 feet above one of the busiest cities in the world. This would create three problems for the docking of the dirigibles. The first problem is hydrogen is what was used in dirigibles and it is extremely flammable. If a dirigible were to explode above downtown New York many people would be killed. This means not many people are going to want the dirigibles docking there. If the Empire State Building had not been above such a densely populated area they may have not had this problem. The next difficulty would be the fact that at that altitude in New York City there are violent wind currents that are always changing. These strong gusts made maneuvering incredibly risky. This makes it hard for the conductors to dock the dirigible and it also could possibly cause the dirigible to hit something and pop. So again the dirigible is falling into downtown New York and killing many people. This is another reason it was a bad location. It needed to be in a place where there were more stable wind currents. The final obstacle was there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This meant that even if the other two factors disappeared there was a law the builders should have known about that forbade their plans. Ultimately, the inherent dangers, unpredictable weather conditions, and legal restrictions made the concept untenable. Like the author said the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose.
633	15466	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. If they were to succeed, they would have become a major aviation accommodation for transatlantic routes and new routes that were yet to come. In order to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the building, the mooring mast needed to be constructed and put on to the top of the building. Simply adding the masts to the building was no easily reached task. The Empire State Building's frame needed to be modified so it could withstand the stress from the dirigible mounted onto the mooring mast, considering the forces exerted by wind and the sheer weight. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications were made to adjust the building's framework. Once the framework was adjusted, architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that was illuminated from the inside. This tower served as a mast for the building to come. Before the mooring mast could be constructed, the roof of the building had to be completed, providing a stable base for the structure. Once the roof was constructed, the mooring mast was added with its own skeleton of steel, ensuring its stability and ability to withstand the immense pressure. Once the entire project was finished, the owners of the Empire State Building realized that docking dirigibles would be much too dangerous, primarily due to unpredictable wind conditions at that height. After all the rigorous work put into the mooring mast was completed, it became clear that it would never be used for its original purpose, marking an ambitious but ultimately impractical chapter in aviation history.
634	15467	6	3	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, one of the obstacles they faced were that ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This is significant because it would be dangerous for foreign dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, especially in a densely populated area such as downtown New York. Another obstacle they faced was nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due violent air currents."" This suggests that a dirigible would swivel around and around and they could be weighted down with lead weights, using these at the Empire State Building, high above pedestrians on the street, would be impractical and unsafe. Next, there was also ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This is important because it is another obstacle that would ultimately make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. Also, ""in December 1930, the U.S Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" This shows that another obstacle they may have faced was losing confidence and directly observing that their plan would not work, and the failed attempt further highlighted the impracticality of the entire endeavor. The various obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there show that it would have been a difficult task to complete."
635	15468	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the main obstacles was the lack of a good landing area. Dirigibles were pretty big, and there wasn't a great spot for it. ""Some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as flour blocks in New York City""- paragraph 6, therefore caused problems to the builders to figure out where to put it, as such a large craft required substantial space to maneuver and safely dock. This limitation ultimately contributed to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan."
636	15469	6	3	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, there were many factors in the way of dirigibles docking at the mooring mast. When the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" went up in flames in New Jersey the owners of the Empire State building realized ""how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place about a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" (paragraph @NUM1). This concern over safety, amplified by the Hindenburg disaster, made the prospect of dirigible landings seem far more dangerous than originally envisioned. Another obstacle was the existing law against low-flying airships in urban areas. This law makes it so that it is ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (paragraph @NUM2). The legal restrictions posed a significant challenge, essentially prohibiting the very activity the mooring mast was designed to facilitate. The greatest obstacle of all however, was mother nature. The winds that high in the sky were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would cause the back of the ship to swivel around and would be unsafe to passengers and pedestrians on the street below. These unpredictable winds at such heights made docking a perilous endeavor. All of these factors contributed to the project never being fulfilled in New York, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the Empire State Building's mooring mast as a practical docking station."
637	15470	6	3	"In a competition with architects building the Chrysler Building, Al Smith wanted to construct a taller building with a purpose. That purpose would be to dock dirigibles on a mooring mast. This seemed like a good idea, taking a mode of transportation very popular and new and allowing it to run in New York City. Then there were problems; in the beginning, the architects knew that ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" So, with the time they had, they assumed that they fixed the problem, but when it was finished, the architects knew that ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to fulfill its purpose..."" Most of the problems didn't arise from the building, but the practicality of having a dirigible land in a big crowded city, such as the highly flammable hydrogen that fills most dirigibles or the closeness of the other buildings to the blimps, could cause them to burn. High winds at that altitude also made docking incredibly dangerous. Overall, the idea was good in theory, but could never be executed. Only two dirigibles ever docked there, and it has never been used since, proving the impracticality of the ambitious plan."
638	15471	6	3	"Although the builders tried hard to make their dream become a reality, there were a few obstacles that prevented that. The main obstacles builders faced were weather, the law, and safety concerns. The weather at the top of the building, already incredibly high, was very windy, and strong winds would cause major issues for the dirigibles landing. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" making docking incredibly difficult and dangerous. Another problem they faced was that there was a law effect preventing aircraft from flying too low over urban areas. Since New York is an urban area with high population density, no dirigibles would even be allowed to fly anywhere near the Empire State Building, rendering the mooring mast useless. The other main obstacle was a concern for safety, especially given the flammable nature of the gases used in dirigibles. Hydrogen, which is extremely flammable, was used in many foreign dirigibles. It could cause a catastrophe if one ever exploded over New York, and there had already been an accident where ""the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937,"" highlighting the dangers involved. These obstacles were not just ones that the builders could ignore, and they ultimately prevented the intended use altogether, leading to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan."
639	15472	6	3	The obstacles faced by the Empire State building builders were, one was the existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas, stated in @CAPS1 @NUM1. Another obstacle was nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. With the dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a cable tether would have put stress on the building, therefore they would have had to make the structure of the building stronger, potentially adding significant costs and complexities to the project.
640	15473	6	3	"The obstacles that the builders were faced with in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building was that they could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building. This is because it would have added too much stress to the frame of the Empire State Building, which could have caused a collapse over a period of time. So the steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be ""modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation,"" as said in the excerpt. After the builders completed framing the Empire State Building up to the eighty-fifth floor, it was now time to do the framing of the rooftop to create an area where the mooring mast would be placed. After the workers completed the framing of the rooftop, they built the mooring mast onto it. Now the builders faced the challenge of framing the mooring mast itself, and they framed the mooring mast with a skeleton of steel. These were the challenges the builders faced in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building."
641	15474	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle they had to overcome was that if a dirigible, which could reach up to a thousand feet in length, was moored to the top of the building it would add stress to the building's frame. This meant the steel frame of the building had to be strengthened and modified to deal with the added stress of the massive airship. The cost of the modifications was over sixty thousand dollars, a significant sum at the time. The next challenge was discovered after the building was finished. This was the fact that having dirigibles moor at the Empire State Building was unsafe. This first reason why it is unsafe is that most dirigibles, not from the United States, used hydrogen instead of helium and hydrogen is highly flammable. This meant an accident like that of the Hindenburg could happen above the highly populated downtown area of New York, posing a catastrophic risk. Another problem that arose after the construction was that the shifting winds on top of the building were too violent for the dirigible, which would swivel around the mooring mast, making docking and passenger transfer extremely difficult and dangerous. All these challenges along with an existing law that did not allow airships to fly too low over urban areas were the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building and is why only one dirigible was ever moored there, effectively ending the ambitious plan.
642	15475	6	3	"Challenges can be faced when radical ideas are put into action. When faced with the task of docking dirigibles, or zeppelins, atop the Empire State Building, the builders ran into challenges that are natural to come along with new thoughts. One challenge included was the fact of the wind from such an altitude as the Empire State Building made situations perilous for blimps and people on the ground. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"". (@CAPS1 @NUM1). Another obstacle faced by builders was difficulties with the laws of the United States government. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" (@NUM2) These difficulties ultimately proved insurmountable, leading to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan. These were some of the difficulties dealt with by builders in the construction of the Empire State Building's mast, demonstrating the practical limitations of even the most innovative ideas."
643	15476	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the fact that dirigibles were dangerous when not handled correctly. If so, many people could die because it was within a densely populated area. In paragraph @NUM1, the author states, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Weather was also an issue in allowing dirigibles to dock there; the wind at that height was very forceful, and would become a problem. In paragraph @NUM2, the author states in relation to the wind, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Another obstacle was the laws against airships flying too low over urban areas. Paragraph @NUM3 states, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even a produced area..."" Ultimately, all of these obstacles made it impossible in the end for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
644	15477	6	3	"The builders of the mooring mast plan the construction well, but did not consider the potential risks of the mast. One reason that the mast's fate was sealed was because of safety issues. Most dirigibles, or blimps, used hydrogen rather than helium, a highly flammable gas. If one of these blimps were to fall from the sky, many people below would be killed. New York has many people that walk everywhere. The builders also needed to considered the violent winds at such a high altitude. These winds could blow the dirigibles around, making it difficult to keep them in one spot for passengers to board, and to refuel. The winds are constantly shifting. They could blow the blimps onto the spires on the Empire State Building, causing them to burst and fall to the ground below. Unfortunately, there is a law that prevents airships from flying too low over urban areas. ""This would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"". It seems that Al Smith was more focused on keeping his height record, more than the potential dangers of the mast. Ultimately, the combination of these safety hazards made the mooring mast a dangerous idea."
645	15478	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the Empire State Building is familiar to many people throughout the world, but not many know that the original purpose of the mast was to serve as a landing spot for dirigibles, also known as blimps. Due to the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, they eventually shelved the idea. One of the obstacles the builders realized was that if a foreign dirigible were to dock and have an accident involving heat or a spark, it would explode and fall to the ground, killing many men, women, and children, due to the chemicals used on foreign dirigibles. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Another obstacle they faced was violent winds that would knock the dirigibles around. ""Winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" All in all, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock eventually led them to abandon the ambitious idea, making it impractical for the building to serve as a mooring mast."
646	15479	6	3	In the story, construction workers faced a problem. The idea of having a dirigible's dock on top of the Empire State Building was coming to an end. When thinking about the idea, the architecture never put thought into legal pressures, as in aircraft can't fly low in urban areas. Also, the heavy wind that picks up from the building made the aircraft hard to control. Another was the dangers they could inflict on civilians. If not right, the aircraft could get loose and dangle down to urban areas, or, like the German dirigible, catch on fire and blow up. Even though they had a prototype that worked, they discontinued the project, giving airplanes the better way to travel in the air, thus ending the age of dirigibles docking atop skyscrapers.
647	15480	6	3	There's more than one obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow blimps to dock there. The biggest obstacle was nature, specifically the winds. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The other practical reason why blimps could not moor on the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, further hindering the ambitious mooring plan. Therefore, both natural elements and legal restrictions contributed to the ultimate failure of the blimp docking station.
648	15481	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when they attempted to allow dirigibles (blimps) to dock there. The greatest obstacle was nature itself. With violent, rapidly changing winds and unpredictable climate, it made it extremely hard to tie dirigibles down securely to the mooring mast atop the skyscraper. The other main reason why dirigibles could not moor on the Empire State Building was the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The dirigibles would never be tied down to the moor because it would break the law. Safety was also a big reason why the dirigibles could not be tied down to the moor. Dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium to fill their dirigibles. The hydrogen is very flammable, so people feared if it were to catch fire over a busy city like New York, all hell would let loose. These were a few examples of the struggles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building, ultimately demonstrating that the dream of dirigible docking was simply not feasible at that time.
649	15482	6	3	In the article The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted the architects of the empire state building faced multiple obsticals in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First there was the obvious concern, safety, a dirigible dangling over New York City does not seem very safe. And it wasn't a reasonable thing to build, the empire state building was already tall enough, why build a mast that probably won't get much use anyway. Ultimately, the idea was abandoned because of these safety and practical concerns.
650	15483	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders wanted to add a mooring mast atop the building, to allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service. They couldn't do that because ""a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" Al Smith didn't get to allow the dirigibles to land on the building because of how skinny the top was, which made it structurally unsound for such a purpose. Ultimately, the impracticality of the design and safety concerns prevented the realization of this ambitious vision."
651	15484	6	3	"In a desperate attempt to revolutionize the way people traveled, the idea of the mooring was not thought over as well as it should have been. The number of problems and obstacles mounted higher and higher with the idea of mooring airships to a new mast atop the Empire State Building. One of these main obstacles was, while an airship was tethered to the building it would add stress, ""The stress of dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"". Another obstacle faced with the mooring mast was one of safety, particularly concerning the highly flammable nature of hydrogen. Dirigibles not from the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, which is Highly flammable. Another obstacle to the construction was nature itself; with high, shifting winds due to violent air currents, a dirigible tethered to the mast would swivel around and around the Empire State Building, the only way to prevent this would be to tie the lead weights to the rear end, but massive dangling weights, hanging over one thousand feet above the public, was not the safest idea. A last obstacle that was faced with the fact that there was an existing law that prevented airships from flying too low over urban areas. These were all obstacles that should have been thought through and realized before construction for the Empire State building's mooring mast ever begin, demonstrating a lack of foresight in the planning stages."
652	15485	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by @PERSON1 there are many reasons that a proper, working Mast was impossible. There were natural reasons and mechanical reasons, as well as time and safety concerns. Nature played a key role in the project's failure; the winds around the building ""were constantly shifting"" because of the building's location and the unpredictable weather patterns. When two blimps attempted to approach the Mast to test it out, one was deemed too unstable to dock safely, and the other mockingly delivered paper down a rope. ""After this stunt the idea of the mooring mast was shelved."" @CAPS1 replaced the blimps over time, and blimps were inherently flammable and dangerous due to the hydrogen they used for lift. Also, flying at that height is illegal, further complicating the practicality of the Mooring Mast. Ultimately, a combination of natural obstacles, mechanical limitations, and safety concerns prevented the successful implementation of the Mooring Mast."
653	15486	6	3	When the builders were almost ready to place the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, big problems became apparent to them that caused complications in docking dirigibles. One factor was that by law, dirigibles couldn't be that low above the city, as they could accidently crash into a building and fall onto the crowds below. Another factor was the air currents around the tall buildings, especially the Empire State Building at a height of 1,250 feet. Even if the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the winds would violently rock it, and could crash against the building and fall to the streets below. A recent factor arose when the Hindenburg dirigible burst into flames from the hydrogen in it when it flew over New Jersey on May 6, 1937. The disaster made everyone aware of the dangers of using hydrogen. Nobody wanted to risk that happening over New York City, either. So because of flammable hydrogen, violent air currents, and legal restrictions, the builders had complications when building the mooring mast to allow dirigibles to land there, ultimately rendering the ambitious plan impractical and unsafe.
654	15487	6	3	Some obstacles were that there were many sharp rods on surrounding buildings, such as lightning rods and flagpoles, and so if the dirigible touched one, it could pop. Another is if the wind is blowing strongly, it was hard and unsafe for the dirigibles to be tied to the building because of the potential for tearing and loss of control. Therefore, careful planning and weather monitoring were essential to safely moor airships.
655	15488	6	3	There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building had to face. One obstacle being constructing a strong enough frame for the building so that a thousand-foot dirigible could be held by the single tether cable intended for mooring. Another obstacle that builders of the Empire State Building faced was safety; how most dirigibles from outside the U.S. at the time used hydrogen rather than helium, which made it very dangerous since hydrogen is very flammable. This made the constructors have to find a way of creating a landing field where the blimp would not touch any of the sharp spires above the Empire State Building, a challenging feat of engineering and design. These were a few of the many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State were faced with during its ambitious construction.
656	15489	6	3	"@ORGANIZATION2's article ""The Mooring Mast"" explains the many problems with using the peak of the Empire State Building to dock dirigibles. First of all, dirigibles that travelled internationally were filled with Hydrogen, a very flammable gas. Having another Hindenburg-style disaster over New York City would be very dangerous. Also, the winds at the top of the spire are rapidly changing and unpredictable, making an approach dangerous for the massive airships. It would normally be okay for a blimp to land in a windy area, because lead weights could be fastened to ropes holding the blimp down. Without landing on the ground, such as just attaching to the spire, there was no way to weigh down the blimp to stabilize it against the strong winds. Finally, a law existed against airships flying too low over urban areas, making a docking at the Empire State illegal. Many practical reasons crushed the dream of having dirigibles dock at the Empire State."
657	15490	6	3	"Many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the architect could not simply drop a mooring on top of the building's flat roof, like it was initially proposed. Also, ""rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a step-back to imitate the overall shape of the building itself."" It became clear that the impracticalities outweighed the potential benefits, leading to the abandonment of the dirigible docking idea altogether."
658	15491	6	3	"The @CAPS1 Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, There were many obstacles the builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 Empire State Building faced to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of their main obstacles the builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 Empire State Building was the framework. They had to design it so the building could bear the stress of the dirigible. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"". In order to make it work, they would use different steel. Another obstacle the builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 Empire State Building would face was safety. Winds and hydrogen were main focuses. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen; hydrogen is highly flammable. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" They would also be careful of pedestrians, as ""they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street"". These are just two examples of what the builders of the Empire State Building @ORGANIZATION1 had to consider to make the dirigible docking mast a reality."
659	15492	6	3	There were a handful of problems that came along with the idea of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building. This idea was hardly practical, for safety reasons mostly. If a dirigible docked there on one cable, extreme tension would be put on the building's mooring mast, potentially compromising its structural integrity. Also, if an international dirigible were to dock filled with very flammable hydrogen and catch fire, the results would be catastrophic for both the building and the surrounding area. The task of actually docking would be a problem as well. With such a high altitude, winds were very strong and unpredictable, making the docking procedure extremely hazardous. Nothing could prevent the dirigibles from swinging around the building, making controlled attachment nearly impossible. In other situations, dirigibles would be weighted down with lead weights to improve stability. However, if these were to fall from such a height, they would land in the busy city streets of New York, posing a significant risk to pedestrians and property. Lastly, there was a law against low flying air ships, completely dismissing the idea of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building, as it would have been a clear violation of existing aviation regulations. Therefore, the concept was fraught with dangers and ultimately unfeasible.
660	15493	6	3	"In trying to build a dock at the top of the Empire State Building for dirigibles, the workers faced many obstacles. One reason is because ""the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) because it would only be held by ""a single cable tether"" (@CAPS1. @NUM1) which would add stress to the building. Reinforcing the structure was possible, but the only way to fix it would be to spend ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications"" to strengthen it. Another obstacle was ""nature itself"" (@CAPS1. @NUM3). This is because the winds would be ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@CAPS1. @NUM3). Attempts to counter this, such as using lead weights to weigh down the back, were deemed not ""practical nor safe"" (@CAPS1. @NUM3). The last reason why is because of the ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" so it would ""Make it illegal for a ship to ever tie to the building."" Due to structural concerns, environmental factors, and legal restrictions, the ambitious plan to dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building ultimately proved unfeasible."
661	15494	6	3	"In an attempt to allow dirigibles, otherwise known as zeppelins or blimps to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles along the way. Al Smith stated ""... engineers here in New York [are] trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement"" (paragraph @NUM1). First, they would not drop a mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof because this would add too much stress to the frame and it would have to be modified to accommodate this new situation"" (paragraph @NUM2). Another obstacle was that most dirigibles outside of the @LOCATION2 use hydrogen, which is very flammable. When the ""Hindenburg"" was destroyed by fire, ""the owners... realized how much worse that could have been if it had taken place above a densly populated area such as downtown New York"" (paragraph @NUM3). The most significant obstacle was ""nature itself"" (paragraph @NUM4). Due to violent air currents, ""the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting"" (paragraph @NUM4); in open areas, dirigibles could be weighted down by lead weights, but this poses a threat to pedestrians on the street, as the weights would be dangling above them. Lastly, there was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM6), making docking at the Empire State building illegal. Because of these significant engineering, safety, and legal issues, the dream of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building ultimately proved to be impossible."
662	15495	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced four main problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of these problems was solved, the other three were not. The first obstacle was that since each dirigible would be connected to the top of the building by a single cable, enormous stress would be put on the frame of the building. This was solved by simply reinforcing the frame of the Empire State Building, but it cost over sixty thousand dollars to make the modifications. The second obstacle was not so easily solved. Dirigibles from other countries use hydrogen to stay afloat. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and the example of the Hindenburg blimp that burst into flame alerted the owners and builders of the Empire State Building to how dangerous an accident like that, especially in densely populated New York City, could be. The third obstacle also proved impossible to solve - because of the high speed of the winds at the top of the building, there would be no way for a dirigible to safely dock. During the only test, the Los Angeles navy dirigible could not get close enough to dock because of the high winds. It would have been all too easy for the dirigible to spin out of control and hit a spire on a nearby building. Lastly, there was already a law in place that prevented dirigibles from flying too close to urban areas, which would make it illegal to dock or fly a ship in New York City. Ultimately, these insurmountable challenges led to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan.
663	15496	6	3	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, the wind was too fast at that altitude, making docking incredibly dangerous. This shows that they didn't want any dirigibles to fall on any stores below. Second, the mooring mast was never fully realized, as the building's structure couldn't easily support the immense forces a docked airship would exert. Third, hydrogen, the gas commonly used to inflate dirigibles, is highly flammable and could catch on fire easily. In brief, there were many problems that made the Empire State Building a bad idea to dock a dirigible.
664	15497	6	3	During the late 1920s and the 1930s, there was a fierce competition arising over constructing the largest building. To set the Empire State Building apart from the Chrysler Building, the developers decided to put a mooring mast for dirigibles. This would have both meaning and make the Empire State Building the world's largest building. The mooring mast was certain to fail for a few reasons. For one, foreign dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is very flammable and would cause a huge fire if ignited. Another reason is above the Empire State Building there are strong winds and currents that are constantly shifting. This would make it very difficult to control the dirigible. Pilots unable to control the dirigible would have great difficulty docking their dirigible. Lastly the mooring dock failed because of the law. This law stated that it is illegal to fly air ships too low over urban areas. On 1931, only one airship, a small Navy dirigible piloted by Lieutenant Commander Herbert V. Wiley, successfully moored to the mast for a mere three minutes. The engineer of the mooring mast was Clavan, who oversaw the construction of the mooring mask. By the late 1930's the Idea was dead, deemed impractical and dangerous, marking the end of a bold but ultimately flawed vision.
665	15498	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a lot of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the lack of suitable landing areas. Dirigibles usually land in open fields, where they are weighed down with lead weights. In New York they would be dangling precariously above pedestrians on the street. Another obstacle was safety. Most dirigibles use hydrogen, which is highly flammable. They worried an accident like the Hindenburg disaster could happen, only this time it would be above a densely populated area. Another obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low in urban areas, so it would be illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building. The final obstacle was forceful winds. These winds could blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings and puncture the shell, leaving the captain in a situation where he couldn't take his hands off the control levers. All in all the mooring mast was not a very well thought-out idea and it would not have been safe at all.
666	15499	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were mainly due to structural and safety issues. According to paragraph @NUM1, ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" This problem required over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications to the building's framework. Although structural issues were a problem, the safety of the pedestrians created an even bigger obstacle for the builders. Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium, which created huge fire hazards. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by a fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area, such as downtown New York"" (paragraph @NUM2). Even though the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas prevented dirigibles from mooring at the Empire State Building, the biggest obstacle of them all was nature itself. The dirigibles' shells could be punctured by the winds constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making the entire endeavor far too risky to be practical."
667	15500	6	3	"The builders have faced many obstacles, from laws to future disasters. There were several problems with the design and location of the mooring mast. One problem was that ""the winds on top of the building, were constantly shifting."" Even though the architects adjusted the design of the mast, it was still too dangerous to land a blimp. Another major problem, was the dirigibles themselves. They were filled with combustable hydrogen. If a blimp was to catch fire, like the Hindenburg, the debris would fall on the pedestrians' below, causing significant harm and damage. The last problem was a law that prevented ""airships flying too low over urban areas."" This made docking at the mast legally problematic. In conclusion, due to laws, the dirigibles and nature, the mooring mast was not used, rendering the ambitious project ultimately unsuccessful."
668	15501	6	3	"The first obstacle is being able to get the passengers on and off due to the height they are already at, creating logistical challenges for safe boarding and disembarkation. Also as stated in paragraph @NUM1 ""the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" @CAPS1 therefore the power of the wind is a huge obstacle, making docking maneuvers difficult and potentially dangerous. Another obstacle stated in paragraph @NUM1 ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against air ships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even approach the area."" @CAPS1 the law was another obstacle they had to face, further complicating any plans to use the building as a docking station. These challenges ultimately proved insurmountable, contributing to the impracticality of the Empire State Building as a dirigible mooring mast."
669	15502	6	3	The architects who built the mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building had many problems with actually docking any dirigibles there. When they were building the idea of being able to dock blimps on the top of a building was revolutionary and ideal. But they had many issues with safety, weather and laws. One issue with safety was that the gas inside the dirigibles, hydrogen, is highly flammable. One accident could harm hundreds of people in New York's streets. The wind on top of the building was also very strong, making it difficult for any blimp to get in close enough. The last difficulty that the builders had was laws. There were certain laws not allowing air ships to fly too low over high populated urban areas. While their mooring mast seemed like a good idea to start out with, sadly it never got much use, and ultimately the impracticality of the design outweighed the initial enthusiasm.
670	15503	6	3	"Based on the information given in the excerpt, the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building had to face were critical to the usage of the dock. Not only is it a challenge to build a 102-story building, but when factoring in wind and other weather conditions, it is not an easy task. In order for the builders of the Empire State Building to create and hoist the dock to the top, they needed to first reinforce the skeleton of the building itself. ""The Architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" Constructing the mooring mast, the builders had to think about the violent wind speeds and the structure of the building to support itself, requiring careful calculations and engineering solutions. There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building had to work through to complete their project, from structural reinforcement to accounting for unpredictable weather."
671	15504	6	3	The obstacle to the successful use of the morning mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making it difficult to maintain a stable position for observation.
672	15505	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The mooring mast wasn't successful, and nature itself proved an impediment. After the initial celebrating, there was disappointment because the dirigibles weren't able to dock as intended. Later, the 1931 blimp Columbia attempted a publicity stunt, aiming to fly up and deliver a bundle of newspapers to the Empire State Building, but this stunt was also unsuccessful, dashing hopes that blimps could be used for transportation in the future.
673	15506	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building had to face in attempt to allow the docking of dirigibles. There was no way architects could drop a mooring mast on top of the building's smooth roof. If a thousand foot dirigible overshadowed the top of the building with only one cable tether, stress the building's frame would be added instantly. Stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would need to be transmitted all the way down to the building's foundation. Another obstacle for the builder's was that the building's steel frame would have to be strengthened to accommodate with this new design and the immense weight. The greatest obstacle in launching this new design was nature and the unpredictable atmospheric conditions. Architects would needed to consider the constant shifting of winds due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible was tied to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would be unsturdy and difficult to manage. The fact that this design would be dangling above the pedestrians on the street, would worry the architects concern of the population's safety. Architects also had to deal with the law against airships traveling too low above urban areas. This law would state the forbidden right of one to tether a large ship to a bulding, or even approach the area and the building. Although there were attempts of dirigible's to reach a bulding, the entire idea was dropped, much to the architects despite, as the challenges ultimately proved insurmountable.
674	15507	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the fact that dirigibles contain highly flammable gases. The hydrogen or helium that kept these airships aloft posed a significant fire risk. If the blimp was docked over a large city like New York City, it would be very dangerous if a blimp did catch on fire. Another obstacle was that the docking system would not work as well as planned, nor would it be safe. These airships are at the mercy of the winds and weather. In normal cases of docking dirigibles on open landing fields, they are weighted down on the front and back. If the blimps were to stay in place on the Empire State Building, they would need to have a weight on the back as well as the front, which would end up dangling over the city. Without the weight on the back, the blimp would spin around the mooring mast. Finally, the height at which the dirigibles would have to be would not be safe. If the blimp were to the blown by the wind, the blimp would crash into the pointy tops of nearby buildings. These safety and logistical concerns ultimately made the dirigible docking plan impractical. These are the obstacles the builders faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building.
675	15508	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle the builders faced was that the building itself would need to be modified. The architects in charge of adding the mooring mast realized that if they were to add the mast as-is, and start mooring dirigibles to it, then there would be too much stress put on the Empire State Building's frame. For this reason they first had to make $2 million worth of changes to the building in order to sufficiently strengthen its frame (paragraph 1). The second obstacle which builders faced in trying to make it possible to moor dirigibles to a mast on the Empire State Building was just general safety. After the Hindenburg disaster of 1937 took place, it became clear to the architect in charge of the project how truly catastrophic an accident like that would have been if it occurred over as highly populated a place as NEW YORK CITY (paragraph 2). It wasn't just the possibility of catastrophic disaster which added to the worry about safety though. Considering the constant violent wind gusts which happen at the height of the mast, architects realized that any dirigible moored up there would be constantly swinging rapidly around the mast. The way this problem is solved when mooring dirigibles on the ground is through the hanging of weights on its back, yet this would present yet another safety issue because if the weight were to fall on the people below it could easily kill somebody (paragraph 3). The final obstacle architects faced was a law outlawing a dirigible flying so low near urban areas in the first place. In the end, the fact that there were so many obstacles prevented the idea of mooring dirigibles there from ever becoming reality at all.
676	15509	6	3	"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the mast. One obstacle they faced was nature itself. The excerpt states that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around."" This could have led to major accidents if the dirigibles were allowed to dock here, making docking incredibly dangerous and impractical. Another obstacle they faced was that these dirigibles could not fly too low over urban cities. It says in the excerpt that ""there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area,"" effectively making the docking plan illegal from the start. But before the idea was even dropped, two dirigibles attempted to reach the building. The first one could not reach the building because of forceful winds, highlighting the difficulty of maneuvering such large airships in unpredictable conditions. The second airship attempted a stunt to drop off a bundle of newspapers. They didn't have the right equipment, so they had to have a worker catch the bundle of papers that were attached by a rope, showcasing the logistical challenges and potential for mishaps. These obstacles were very important to the construction of the mast because they probably saved the lives of not only the aviators but also the people that lived in the urban cities below, ultimately proving the mooring mast concept to be unfeasible and potentially disastrous."
677	15510	6	3	"In the 1920's, dirigibles were known as the transportation of the future. After the Empire State Building was built, the builder's attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. There were three main reasons that prevented the builders from attempting to allow dirigibles to dock, at the top of the Empire State Building. ""The one obstacle to there expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" Al Smith thought that if a mooring mast was added to the top of the building, it would allow dirigibles to anchor there for hours. But it was not easy for the architects to drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof; this was a complex engineering challenge. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the moorin Mast was nature itself."" The violent air currents from the wind, would caused the back of the ship to Swivel around the moorin mast. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire state Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" In the end two dirigibles attempted it, but it didn't work, rendering the docking station impractical and ultimately ending the vision of the Empire State Building as a dirigible terminal."
678	15511	6	3	There were many obstacles builders faced while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building. The first problem they faced was safety. A lot of dirigibles, especially those from outside the United States, used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. So this was not safe in a place with a big population like downtown New York to have a dirigible fly that low. It is not safe because in case of an accident, there could be a large number of deaths. The second obstacle the builders faced was that the winds on the top were constantly blowing and could not allow the dirigible to stabilize in one place. Instead, it would just go around and around the mast, making docking extremely difficult. The third and last obstacle that the builders faced was the law. There was a law that did not allow airships to fly too low over urban areas. So it was illegal for a ship to be tied on the Empire State Building, effectively ending the ambitious plan.
679	15512	6	3	"On December 11, 1929, Al Smith Announced that the Empire State building would be reaching the height of 1,250 feet; taller then the previous largest building, the Chrysler Building. Smith made the building taller by adding a top or a hat. John @CAPS1 described this as ""[The top of the empire State Building] would be more than an ornament... The empire state building would be equipped for an age of transportation that was then only the dream of a few aviation pioneers"" (pg 1). This dream consisted of having a mooring mass at the top of the building to dock dirigible, or blimbs. However, many obsticles emerged the more they began to plan this, such as the amount of stress it would add to the buildings frame, the use of hydrogen opposed to helium, and simply nature itself. ""A thousand-foot drigible held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame... The Empire State building would have to... [have] over @MONEY1 worth of modifications (pg @NUM1). ""Most diribles from outside of the U.S used hydrogen... and hydrogen is highly flammable (pg @NUM1)"". ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents... they would be dangling high above pedestrians... that was neither safe nor practical. Ultimately, the impracticality and dangers associated with mooring dirigibles to the Empire State Building made the ambitious plan unfeasible, and it was eventually abandoned."
680	15513	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there included the fact that dirigibles had a top speed of eighty miles per hour. The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mass. The body of the dirigibles could swing in the breeze, and yet passengers could safely get on and off, further complicating the docking process at such a height.
681	15514	6	3	The builders faced many obstacles while building a mast for dirigibles on the Empire State Building. One was that they had to strengthen the foundation so that all the stress on the building's structure wouldn't tear it apart, requiring significant engineering adjustments. Also, the fact it was impractical for a dirigible mast because shifting currents and winds would either make it impossible to land or would circle the blimp around and hit buildings presented major safety concerns. The workers faced these obstacles and finally realized that they couldn't do it, leading them to abandon the original ambitious plan.
682	15515	6	3	"The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2 outlines the problems architects had when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building. The idea was impractical, mainly because of safety reasons. Most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, which is highly flammable. If an accident were to occur, the dirigible would crash into the thousands of pedestrians in New York City. Nature was another reason why this idea was impractical. In New York City, there was constantly shifting winds that swiveled the dirigible out of control, even when docked. Some dirigibles used lead weights to prevent the back from swiveling, but in New York City ""they would be dangling above pedestrians on the street... neither practical nor safe."" @CAPS1, air laws prevented the dirigible docks from becoming a reality. These regulations prohibited dirigibles from flying at the low altitudes needed to reach the mast. Mooring masts were impractical and ""never fulfilled its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."""
683	15516	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, there were a few obstacles while trying to build a dock for the Empire State Building. The first obstacle was the little room they had for a landing spot. New York has a lot of people in it and a lot of buildings. ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" They were very big, airships sometimes stretching hundreds of feet, so they needed enough room not to hit anything else. Secondly was safety. They had to think about all the people and how close it would be to the building itself, ensuring no part of the massive airship collided during docking. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" If the wind blew too hard, it could swing the airship back into the building, causing damage and endangering passengers. Lastly, the danger of the weights being over a whole bunch of people's heads was pretty serious. ""... using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street..."" If one were ever to fail, the heavy equipment falling from such a height would probably kill someone. No one would ever get over what happened, making safety a paramount concern in the mooring mast's design."
684	15517	6	3	Some obstacles that the Empire State builders had to face when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were that a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, added stress to the building's frame. The steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be modified and strengthened to accommodate it with the new situation, which the cost was going to be over sixty thousand dollars, a considerable sum at the time. Another obstacle to allow dirigibles was the mast; an obstacle of the mast was nature itself. The winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents at that height. When the dirigibles were going to land, the back of the ship was going to swivel around the mast, causing it to not be safe. These issues, coupled with practical difficulties, ultimately led to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan.
685	15518	6	3	Builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of them was not being able to just drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A dirigible attached the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would stress the building frame. Its weight and air pressure would weaken the foundation of the Empire State Building. They had to make sixty thousand dollars worth modifications to the framework so it could be strong enough to withstand the weight of the dirigibles. Another problem was the mooring mast not fulfilling its purpose, which should have been thought about before it was built; safety. Many countries outside the U.S. used hydrogen instead of helium, hydrogen is really flammable. There was an incident where a blimp was destroyed in a fire due to hydrogen in their balloon, raising concerns about potential disasters. The biggest challenge was the wind above the building. The wind was constantly shifting because of violent air currents. If the blimp was tethered to the mooring mast, the back would turn on the mooring mast, making docking incredibly dangerous. Blimps use weights to land in open fields but couldn't over the Building because weights dangling over pedestrians wasn't safe. Ultimately, these significant logistical and safety hurdles made docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building an impractical and ultimately abandoned endeavor.
686	15519	6	3	"During the attempt in building a docking station for dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building, many obstacles made this idea less and less possible. One huge problem was due to the building's foundation. A swinging blimp, which can be up to a thousand feet in length, on top of the building would add a huge amount of stress. This meant extra money would need to be dumped into the strengthening of the foundation and framework, in order to support a huge zeppelin on the mooring mast. Since the building tops out at 1,250 feet in altitude, fierce air currents rip through the top of the building. This caused impossible docking conditions because the blimp could hit the building and pop. Due to the flammability of hydrogen, this dangerous eruption could wreak havoc on the densely populated city below. Referring to the Hindenburg explosion in Lakehurst, 1937, ""The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if taken place above a densely populated area."" The potential for catastrophe, coupled with the significant structural and financial challenges, ultimately proved insurmountable. Due to these mainly safety reasons, the docking station for dirigibles was never built."
687	15520	6	3	"There were numerous obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One big problem they faced was the wind. The way the mooring station was built meant that the wind could catch the tail of the dirigible, causing it to spin around the building. Also, when the mooring station was completed, the wind made it unsafe for dirigibles to get close to the building. Another problem they faced was the stability and support of the building. ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's Framework."" This was so a blimp wouldn't pull the mooring station off the building. One final problem they faced was the safety of the people. It is said that most dirigibles use flamible gasses to fly. If there was an accident like the Hindenburg over the busy New York streets it would be terrible. There were many problems faced by the building crew of the Empire state building, wind, stability, and safety are just a few, but they represent the complexity of such an ambitious undertaking."
688	15521	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the very important obstacles they had to face was the thousand-foot dirigible adding stress to the buildings frame. Therefore, the building's structure would ""... have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" Furthermore, the builders face the obstacle of safety. Dirigibles used hydrogen, ""... rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The potential for disaster was a significant concern. The greatest obstacle faced by the builders was nature. As the winds were shifting at the top of the building, the back of the dirigibles swiveled around the mast. Previous solutions; ""dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighed down in the back with lead weights..."" were not safe with the mooring mast on the Empire State Building, making docking a hazardous proposition. Lastly, an obstacle they faced was that there was a ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" this made it so the dirigibles could not even legally approach this area. There were several obstacles faced when the builders were trying to make the Empire State building a docking station, ultimately rendering the ambitious plan impractical."
689	15522	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while building it, some of those obstacles being safety, the technology they had, and the planning that they put into building the mooring mast. There problems with the safety of the mooring mast was that dirigibles that were from countries other than the @LOCATION1 use hydrogen instead of helium. Hidrogen is very flammable so the risk of a fire in the dirigible was very great. Also another problem the builders faced with safety was that the winds on top of the building would be much too great to succesfully land a dirigible. The problems that the builders faced with technology was that they didn't have the technology to succesfully land a @DATE1 ft dirigible at the top of a tower using a single cable because it would add stress to the buildings frame, and the stress from the wind pressure would be hazardous to the buildings frame. The obstacles that the builders faced with the planning of the mooring mast was that they didn't plan well enough and that they should have seen that the mast would be a failure from the start, ultimately leading to its limited use.
690	15523	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced certain obstacles in attempting to permit dirigibles to dock. The three main obstacles the builders faced were their concern for safety, nature itself, and the existing laws of airships. Safety is a major factor when constructing. The builders had the chance of using hydrogen rather than helium, risking the fact of how highly flammable hydrogen is. They later realized how bad it could have been if what happened to the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" on May 6, 1937, could have happened to them taking place above a ""densely populated"" area like New York City. Nature itself was also an obstacle because the winds on top were shifting constantly. This could potentially cause the back of the dirigible to ""swivel"" around, as well around the mooring mast. The final obstacle was that of the ""existing laws against aircrafts flying too low over urban areas."" They feared that the winds would blow the dirigibles into sharp spires of other structures and puncture the dirigible's shell. After two failed attempts, they decided to cancel the construction of the ""Mooring Mast"" due to ""the unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height that made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear,"" thus concluding the ambitious yet ultimately unsuccessful endeavor."
691	15524	6	3	"The builders faced many problems in their attempts to allow a dirigible to land at the Empire State Building. One of the main reasons was safety, ""most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable,"" making it too large of a risk to allow such a dirigible over New York. Another problem was the air currents: ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" making docking incredibly difficult. A final problem was a law ""against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law would forever prohibit any airship to dock with the mast, or even approach the city to attempt to dock, effectively ending the dirigible-docking dream."
692	15525	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The obstacles were safety, nature, and laws. Most foreign dirigibles used hydrogen which is highly flammable instead of helium. If a dirigible were to catch on fire above a very populated city the outcome would be bad, endangering countless lives below. The winds that high were very violent. There was no way to keep a dirigible still, even though the front is hooked to the building the back would swing, creating a dangerous situation. It was not safe. There was a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. It was illegal to fly close to the building or to dock at it, making the entire endeavor legally impossible. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in trying to allow dirigibles to dock there, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the ambitious plan.
693	15526	6	3	The building of the Empire State building was a project which faced many obstacles. Due to the additional plan of building a mooring mast at the top of the building, a series of challenges and possibilities were forced to be taken into consideration. Firstly, the addition of a mooring mast to the top of the building would significantly weigh down the building, adding stress to its frame. Because of this, over @MONEY1 worth of modifications would have to be made to enforce the building's frame and stabilize it as a whole. Laws and regulations about how high airships could hover over urban areas also restricted the use of the mast, as because the building was located in the middle of a city, a densely populated area with thousands of pedestrians below, it was clearly neither practical nor safe. Furthermore, nature itself was the greatest obstacle to the success of the mast, as many foreign dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium; this risked a fire hazard, particularly given the electrical activity common during thunderstorms. Lastly, strong winds and violent air currents all in all prevented the construction of the mast, as using the top of the building as a dock for airships maybe just a bit far fetched, thereby rendering the initial mooring plan ultimately unfeasible.
694	15527	6	3	There were many obstacles that the workers had to overcome to succeed in the process of the mast. They had to figure out how they were going to land the big aircraft on the small framed building. Also the workers needed to figure out a way to safely get the passengers on and off the aircraft while the tail was whipping around in the air. They needed to talk and consult with the U.S. Naval Air station because they were leaders in research of the dirigibles. Another obstacle the workers had to overcome was the law against low flying aircraft in New York City. So those are some obstacles that the constructors of the mast had to overcome to build the mast upon the Empire State building in New York City. These problems needed solutions for the mast to function as intended.
695	15528	6	3	"Being an architect and construction worker is one of the hardest jobs in the world, especially at an elevation of @NUM1 feet. Building the Empire State building was no easy task. An even more challenging task was building a mooring mast, a docking area for dirigibles, on top of the Empire State Building. Since the building had a flat roof, ""architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building."" Architects had to build an extension in the shape of a rocket jutting out from the flat roof. The Architects also realized that having a single cable at the top of the extension to hook onto the dirigible, would add tremendous stress to the building. They had to find a way to ease the stress to the building's foundation, considering the immense weight and potential wind resistance involved. Although the architects faced challenges they did overcome them and planned to put their ideas into action, ultimately ensuring the structural integrity of the iconic skyscraper."
696	15529	6	3	In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. One obstacle being to much stress on the buildings frame, as the mooring mast would transmit considerable force. The dirigible would somehow have to be connected to the frame, which was @NUM1 feet below, adding to the engineering challenges. Another problem the builders faced was safty. The workers initially wanted to use hydrogen to keep the dirigibles afloat, but realized hydrogen is flamable and posed a great risk to the building and city. Other problems where nature and law. Nature's winds at that altitude would complicate the dirigibles from staying still and docking safely. Law stated that the dirigibles would be flying to low for urban areas, violating air space regulations. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems that ultimately led to a plan that failed to become a practical reality.
697	15530	6	3	Many years ago, people sought a new and more practical mode of transportation. Upon being introduced to the dirigible (or blimp), it was believed that this small aircraft could be the transportation of the future. Plans were made for a mast to be constructed atop the Empire State building located in New York City. The project was soon underway, but not without obstacles along the way. Hazards in nature, construction of the Empire State Building, and differences between American and German dirigibles hindered the success of the mooring mast. It is a well-known fact that nature can be unpredictable and incredibly harsh. This makes all transportation, especially transportation by air, difficult and dangerous. In the construction of the mooring mast, violent wind currents were noted. It would be nearly impossible to allow a dirigible to dock atop the Empire State Building on a very windy day because only the front portion of the aircraft would be secure. This endangers pedestrians. Secondly, it was noted that the Empire State Building's roof required improvements in order for dirigibles to dock there. Upon being secured by one cable tether, the weight of the dirigible would press on the building. This could potentially be hazardous, and cost about $500,000 to fix. Lastly, dirigibles from other countries would not be able to fly to the United States. American dirigibles are filled with helium, which made it very light and easy to fly. German models used hydrogen, which happens to be incredibly flammable. After a German dirigible was damaged beyond repair by fire, it was determined that these models could not be used. Ultimately, the dangers associated with using dirigibles for travel outweighed the benefits. It was determined that too many accidents could because by dirigibles, so the Empire State Building had to be used another way.
698	15531	6	3	The obstacles the builders had to go through to allow dirigibles to dock there was by an electrical winch. By tying it to the mast, the wind pressure was a significant factor. The mooring location needed to be in an open field and weighed down in the back with lead weights. They tried to tie the building but it was illegal so they couldn't do it. Because of the forceful winds, they also couldn't tie it onto the building directly. The dirigible mooring equipment was never installed in either location. Dirigibles and their passengers had quietly disappeared and didn't become a major form of transportation, instead having given way to airplanes, thus ending the era of these giant airships as practical passenger vehicles.
699	15532	6	3	Some problems the designers faced were the violent air currents that form in urban areas; this would be a problem because the dirigible would be tossed around due to its light weight. Another problem is the fact that it would be too dangerous to land a dirigible over a densely populated area like New York City, creating significant safety concerns for those on the ground. These challenges highlight the difficulties in adapting lighter-than-air technology to the complexities of modern urban environments.
700	15533	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock were very difficult. The builders had to modify and strengthen the building to support the anticipated loads. The modifications were very expensive, costing ""over sixty thousand dollars"". Another obstacle the builders faced were the winds on the top of the building. The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents and made the docking process treacherous. Even if the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast the back of the ship would swivel around, making passenger transfer dangerous. Also, they faced the safety concerns. Builders were afraid that a disaster would happen because the dirigibles refill of hydrogen is very flammable. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" A single spark could ignite the hydrogen and destroy the dirigible and the building. Another reason the docking plan failed was that the law against airships flying too low over urban areas effectively prohibited it. This law made it clear that the dock would never happen. Even though they were pretty high off the ground, the height was still insufficient to comply with the law. They couldn't even tie it up and secure it so it wouldn't fall because it was still against the law. This law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. Ultimately, a combination of cost, safety concerns, weather conditions, and legal restrictions made the dirigible docking plan for the Empire State Building impractical and ultimately unworkable."
701	15534	6	3	"In Marcia Amidon Lusted's short story ""The Mooring Mast,"" the builders of the Empire State Building encountered three significant obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. Safety concerns were paramount. First, most dirigibles arriving from outside the United States relied on hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, unlike helium. A flammable ship situated above a densely populated area like downtown New York could lead to disaster. The second safety issue arose from the consistently shifting winds and violent air currents at the building's summit. The prospect of dirigibles dangling precariously high above pedestrians was deemed neither practical nor safe. Finally, the Empire State Building project faced a legal hurdle. An existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. This law effectively made it illegal for an airship to dock at the building or even approach the immediate vicinity. These safety obstacles, coupled with the restrictive law, ultimately rendered any attempts to dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building unfeasible."
702	15535	6	3	"According to the excerpt from @ORGANIZATION2's ""The Mooring Mast"", the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. When Al Smith was first planning the structure and use of the mass, he seems to be overambitious. In paragraph @NUM1, the reader gets the sense of how competitive Smith was, which is a quality that can get in the way of practicality. Smith's determination to have the Empire State Building be the tallest was an obstacle because it was what first initiated the idea of the mooring mast. Although it is made clear in the section ""Designing the Mast"" that a lot of planning went into the building of the mast, the extra effort needed for this was an obstacle as well. The mast delayed completing the whole building, and as @PERSON1 says in paragraph @NUM2, the mast caused unsolved problems and postponements in construction. A significant reason for the failure of the mast was the issue of safety because the dirigibles were highly flammable. As it also says in paragraph @NUM3, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself,"" referencing the unpredictable and often severe weather conditions at such heights. These both show the impracticality of the installment of a dirigible dock, revealing the largest obstacles the builders faced. Because ambition was more important than practicality in the building of the mooring mast, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles and ultimately failed in their endeavor."
703	15536	6	3	The challenges the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the lack of a suitable land area at the building's summit for maneuvering. Another obstacle they faced was that the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making docking dangerous. They also had to make sure that no sharp objects would puncture the dirigibles as they approached. These are the challenges the builders of the Empire State Building faced, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the airship docking idea.
704	15537	6	3	"From what seemed to be a very possible way to make the Empire State Building famous to realizing how hard it was going to be, the builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. These problems included added stress to the building's frame. Therefore, the foundation would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this added stress, which meant more time and money. Not only did the builders have to worry about structural issues, but also the winds. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" making docking a dangerous proposition. After all of the obstacles, the builders finally realized that this ""dream"" was impossible to overcome, and the idea was ultimately abandoned due to the impracticality and inherent dangers it presented."
705	15538	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building were having many problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Their first problem was that they could not drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire state building, mainly because it's only held by a single tether, and because it would add stress to the building's frame. Another issue was that the wind speeds were so much greater at the top of the building that it pushed the dirigibles away from the docking station. Also, most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium to stay aloft, and hydrogen is extremely flammable. For the creators of the building, the idea just seemed unpractical; a dirigible would be too hard to keep in one place dangling 1250 feet in the air above New York City, making the concept ultimately unfeasible.
706	15539	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that United States dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If the dirigible was ever destroyed by fire above a densely populated area like downtown New York the accident could be very dangerous. One of the greatest obstacles of using the mooring mast was nature itself. The author says ""The winds on top of building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Dangling lead weights to weigh it down over pedestrians on the streets was neither practical nor safe. These significant challenges ultimately proved insurmountable. The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2 tells a few obstacles the builders had to face to allow dirigibles to dock the Empire State Building."
707	15540	6	3	"In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, she describes the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph Four it says, ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" This would mean that there was not much room for the dirigibles when not in use. This made it difficult to store them safely and efficiently. In paragraph sixteen it says, ""The U.S Navy dirigible Los Angeles approach to the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds"". This means that weather could make traveling dirigibles very dangerous, especially the high altitude winds around the Empire State Building. Thus, the lack of space and the impact of weather conditions were critical challenges to the practicality of dirigible docking."
708	15541	6	3	"In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building some obstacles they faced were challenging. One name they called the dirigibles in the 1920's and 1930's was ""Transportation of the Future"". There was also an existing law against airships flying too low over open areas. The builders had to make lots of changes to make this perfect and get it the way they want it. Safety was the most important, most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen instead of using helium. Although hydrogen is highly flammable, they still used it because it was cheaper and provided greater lift. In addition ""The highest open observation deck, Intended for disembarking passengers, has never been open to the public"", and to this day remains inaccessible, symbolizing the unrealized ambition of transatlantic airship travel directly to the heart of New York City."
709	15542	6	3	The three insurmountable obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building were all a matter of public safety. They should have realized that most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, and that they were thus prone to exploding. In an urban city like New York, a thousand-foot dirigible that would cover four blocks would cause immense casualties in the event of such an explosion. Secondly, violent air currents cause the winds at the top of the Empire State Building to be constantly shifting and swirling. The mooring mast, designed to secure the airships, would not work in that environment unless the back of the dirigible were weighted down with lead weights to stabilize it. The lead weights dangling high above pedestrians on the street would be neither practical nor safe. Thirdly, the importance of public safety from aircraft had already been realized in the form of a law banning airships from flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. Docking in an urban setting proved too dangerous to risk, making the ambitious plan ultimately untenable.
710	15543	6	3	"Although the purpose of the mooring mast was to help dock passengers safely from the dirigible, there were many difficulties that could have endangered many. ""When the German dirigible '@CAPS1' was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" (paragraph @NUM1) This shows that if an accident like a dirigibles flaming up above New York, there would be many serious injuries. ""In December 1930, the U.S. dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mass could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" (paragraph @NUM2) The process of docking a dirigible to the mooring mast was indeed a dangerous proposition, especially when considering the potential for strong winds to interfere with the procedure. The toughest obstacle was to tie up the dirigible while the wind was extremely blowing at it. The idea of using the mooring mast atop of the Empire State Building was then, dropped, due to these safety concerns and logistical challenges."
711	15544	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted the were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle the builders faced was finding a way to have a dirigible moored on top of the Empire State building without adding stress to the buildings frame. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"" (L¸sted). Another obstacle that was face was money. they needed to make more than sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications. ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"" (L¸sted). The biggist obstacle the builders had to face was nature, the winds would shift the dirigible to much. ""The greatest obstacle to the success of the mooring mast was nature itself"" (L¸sted). The winds proved to be too unpredictable and strong for the dirigibles to safely dock. As you can see there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."
712	15545	6	3	Although they made a valiant effort to make a seemingly ingenious idea into reality, the obstacles faced by the constructors of the Empire State Building in creating a dock for dirigibles proved to be insurmountable. One of the challenges faced by the builders was the tumultuous winds at the top of the Empire State Building. These forceful gales made it virtually impossible to maneuver a dirigible at that elevation, much less dock it to a building. Another barrier that the architects faced was the fact that there was a law saying that airships were forbidden from flying too close to the ground above urban areas, and this regulation effectively grounded any hopes of commercial dirigible traffic. This meant that it would be even illegal for any dirigible to even come close to the Empire State Building. Finally, the creators of the Empire State Building faced the challenge of safety: Airships are filled with highly flammable hydrogen, and an airship explosion over a densely populated urban area would have horrific results, making the entire concept far too risky for practical implementation.
713	15546	6	3	The builders faced many problems attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. First of all, tying a dirigible with one cable would add tremendous weight to the frame of the building. In order for this to be possible, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be strengthened which would add an additional cost of @MONEY1. After the mast was built, the Empire State Building faced new problems as well. Most dirigibles used hydrogen which was highly flammable, posing a significant fire risk. After what happened to the Hindenburg, the architects knew that the results would have been much worse in a densely populated area such as New York City. Another problem was that it was too risky to have a big dirigible hanging above pedestrians a few thousand feet in the air. The law also hindered Al Smith's idea. The law stated that airships were prohibited from flying too low over urban areas. When the dirigible Los Angeles attempted a trial, builders found that the wind blew too high for the dirigible and they feared it would fly into nearby buildings. Due to all of these insurmountable obstacles, the idea of dirigibles was soon forgotten and gave way to airplanes.
714	15547	6	3	"In the excerpt, 'The Mooring Mast' by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the constructors of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while trying to create a docking place on such a tall building. Obstacles like a law against airships flying too low and nature itself made it hard to create such a place. In paragraph @NUM1, it says, ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" There was already a strong argument against building the mast, but Al Smith ignored it. This law made it illegal for ships to ever tie up to the building. In paragraph @NUM2, the author tells why nature was a problem; she says, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Already, the conditions are showing signs of the danger ahead if they pursued the idea any farther. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields and could be weighed down by lead weights. However, using these in the Empire State Building where they would be dangling in the air wasn't practical nor safe, especially considering the strong and unpredictable winds. All those reasons contribute to the reason why docking wasn't allowed, highlighting the impracticality and inherent dangers of the ambitious mooring mast concept."
715	15548	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The greatest one being violent winds so high up, a significant challenge to controlling such a large craft. The back of the zeppelin would swivel around the mooring mast, making passenger transfer difficult and potentially dangerous. There was also the fear of it blowing into the sharp spires of nearby buildings, causing it to burst and endangering those below. They couldn't use lead weights to hold it in place, because it wouldn't be safe to have them dangling above the streets in case they fell. There was, at the time, a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, for simelar reasons of safety. This would have made it illegal for a zeppelin to dock there anyway. These are some obvious problems, overlooked in the design of the mooring mast, rendering the ambitious plan ultimately impractical.
716	15549	6	3	"In the nonfiction excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @PERSON1, the architects faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle the architects faced was the lack of a suitable landing area. There was nowhere to land the blimps in a densely populated urban environment. ""A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers on and off."" This quote is saying that they needed to build a mooring mast to overcome the obstacle of the blimps not having a designated area to land. The second obstacle they faced was the architects couldn't just drop a mooring mass on top of the building. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by single cable wether, would add stress to the building's frame."" This quote is saying the stress of the load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted and the steel frame of the building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation, requiring significant structural engineering adjustments. The third obstacle, which was perhaps the greatest obstacle, was the successful and safe use of the mooring mast itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This quote is saying the very nature of the mooring mass itself was dangerous because the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mass, making it unsafe for passengers and crew. Those three obstacles were what the architects faced in order to build the mooring mass, in which to compete in having the highest building in the world, and they would need to overcome these challenges to make their vision a reality."
717	15550	6	3	"There were several obstacles to the success of the construction. Perhaps the main obstacle, the obstacle that nothing could be done about, was the wind itself. On paragraph @NUM1 it mentions how the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. These giant- balloon like machines would constantly swivel around the mooring mast even if they were tied down. The Hindenburg disaster on May 6, 1937 also proved how dangerous it would be to have blimps filled with highly flammable hydrogen gas over a densely populated area, like downtown New York. The project was also held back by existing laws about flight in an urban area. ""It was illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" -says the author on paragraph @NUM2. Incoming blimps would simply be flying too low against law for this to work. Thus, several factors, from unpredictable weather to legal restrictions and safety concerns, all conspired to prevent the blimp mooring project from ever truly succeeding."
718	15551	6	3	"The Empire State Building builders faced different obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders first had to learn about the mooring lines, and how they would function. They ""consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations"" to learn more about them first hand, gaining crucial knowledge. The builders also had to worry about the frame of the Empire State Building. The frame ""would have to be modified and strengthened to accomodate this new situation,"" ensuring it could withstand the forces involved. This meant the builders would have to go back and work on the frame again, adding to the complexity of the project. Attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building caused the builders to face different obstacles, requiring them to acquire new expertise and revisit previous work."
719	15552	6	3	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, the architects went through many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. The engineers had to go through different experiences and consult with experts, and take tours of the equipment that would be used on the project, carefully considering the mechanics and logistics. The architects had to realize they couldn't simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building; they had to realize the consequences and danger, like the immense wind pressure at that altitude. Also, fires, if a fire were to happen, many people would get hurt or killed due to New York's dense population. The architects faced many obstacles, but these challenges ultimately taught them about the potential danger and outcome if building the mooring mast without proper planning and safety measures.
720	15553	6	3	There were many obstacles that the architects working on the mooring mast of the Empire State building had to face. The first was the fact that dirigibles were not becoming the next transportation craze as initially hoped. Without dirigibles to use the mast, it would serve no purpose, rendering a key design element obsolete. Another obstacle was the laws in place that prevented dirigibles from flying too low over urban areas. So no dirigibles could have legally docked at the mast anyway, regardless of their popularity. A final obstacle was nature itself. Fierce winds at the top of the building could spin the dirigibles around, making docking a dangerous and ultimately impractical proposition.
721	15554	6	3	When building the Empire State Building, builders faced many obstacles attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. From the reading excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted stated that dirigibles were as long as one thousand feet, that's four blocks in New York City. This brought up the first obstacle, which is they have nowhere to land this thing. They couldn't put it above New York because of an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Architects also had to find a way to redesign the building so that it could support the weight of the dirigible, which was a considerable engineering challenge. The biggest obstacle they faced was nature. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing, and although it would be tied down to the building, the back of it would still be swirling, causing instability. They didn't have a way to fix that, because usually dirigibles were weighed down with cylinder blocks in an open field, and it would be too risky to do that over a populated area. These compounding issues ultimately proved insurmountable, leading to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan.
722	15555	6	3	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1 wanted to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State building for refueling and services and to let passengers off and on. However, the builders of the Empire State Building went through many obstacles to allow this to happen. ""The architects and engineers of the Empire State Building consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations at the @ORGANIZATION3 in Lakehurst, New Jersey"" (∂@NUM1). They had to meet with experts and analyze if that was going to be a successful idea. ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill it's purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed....the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"" (∂'s @NUM2 & @NUM3). Another obstacle that the builders had to deal with was nature. The high altitude winds proved to be unpredictable and very strong, therefore the idea of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building was not successful, rendering the mooring mast's intended function obsolete."
723	15556	6	3	Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles during construction. While designing the mast, the architects realized they couldn't just drop the mooring mast onto the Empire State Building, as this would add stress to the building's frame. So, the building would have to be modified and strengthened to withhold these conditions. Then the builders ran into a problem with safety; the winds on top of the building were violent and constantly shifting. This would cause the dirigible to swivel around the mast. They then decided to add lead weights to weigh the dirigible down, but having those dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe. Lastly, existing laws against airships flying low over urban areas made it illegal to complete their goal. Overall, the planning of the Empire State Building had many difficulties that ultimately made the original vision for the mooring mast impossible to achieve.
724	15557	6	3	When building the mooring mast of the Empire State Building, architects faced many obstacles, such as spontaneous combustion, nature, and airship related laws. The first issue faced by builders was spontaneous combustion. Due to the accidental fire on the Hindenburg, the owners of the Empire State building realized that if a dirigible lit up on their building, the results would be even worse, for debris would fall on the busy New York streets. A second issue builders faced was mother nature herself. Because of violent air currents, the winds above the building were constantly changing. This would mean that even if docked and tethered, the back of the ship would still spin. Normally, lead weights held down dirigibles in fields, but over New York City would be dangerous for they could snap off and fall to the pedestrians below. Finally, there were laws set in place regulating airship flight that held back construction. These laws set a limit on heights above urban areas, making a dock to the Empire State building, or even just approaching it, illegal. Builders of the mast on the Empire State building faced many obstacles during construction, such as fires, nature, and the law, ultimately rendering the mooring mast impractical for its intended purpose.
725	15558	6	3	"The builders of the @CAPS1 Empire State Building faced many problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Their first problem was that it would add lots of stress to the building. This means if they had a dirigible tied up to the building in the wind it would put weight on the building or pull it around. ""Nature was their greatest obstacle"" and it was very unsafe to have something like that hanging over the crowded streets of New York. In an attempt to make the building stronger the builders had to spend over ""sixty thousand dollars"" on the improvement of the skeleton or frame. There were also laws in place that did not allow large aircraft to fly low over a crowded city. This tells us that even if they did build the mast it would be illegal for the dirigibles to land there. There were many problems and, ultimately, the ambitious plan for the landing of a dirigible on the Empire State Building never happened."
726	15559	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced countless problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One main problem is safety. Even though the dirigibles were going to be hooked on top of the building, the wind could potentially whip the dirigible and cause it to crash into the building. The docking mast itself might not have been strong enough to withstand the forces of a large airship in strong winds. Also, after the crash of the Hindenburg, the builders realized how much damage could be done if that were to happen in New York, which would make the top of the Empire State Building an even bigger disaster. Another problem they faced is the laws. The law prohibited any aircraft flying too low over urban areas, making the entire concept legally questionable. These problems ultimately caused this ambitious idea to disappear.
727	15560	6	3	"From the idea of building the Empire State Building to attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, the builders faced different obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Al Smith thought it was a good idea to add a mooring mast so dirigibles could dock there for several hours. However, in order to allow dirigibles to dock there, builders had to transmit all the stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure to the building's foundation because a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building could add stress to the frame of the building. One of the greatest obstacle builders faced was the wind or nature; the strength of the wind were constantly shifting due to violent air currents at that height. For safety reason, most dirigibles weren't safe because they mostly used hydrogen, and hydrogen is flammable, further complicating matters. Another obstacle they faced was an existing law that didn't allow airships to fly too low over urban areas. Irving Clavan said, ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring air ships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear."" Due to the combination of these obstacles, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles ultimately disappeared."
728	15561	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, L¸sted addresses many of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. They had to make many adjustments to the building's framework, the safety of the dirigibles was dangerous, and nature itself posed as a huge obstacle for the builders.First, the architects realized that they could not drop a mooring mast to the top of the Empire State Building because of the stress it would add to the building's framework. As L¸sted states, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" The architects then had to make adjustments which would strengthen the building to allow the docking of the dirigibles. These improvements cost the architects $2,000,000!The second obstacle faced by the builders was the safety of the dirigibles. At the time most of the dirigibles were filled with hydrogen which was highly flammable. The architects saw how dangerous this could be when they witnessed the destruction of the German Hindenburg blimp in 1937. If the same thing was to happening in New York, which is a densely populated area, it could cause serious damage.Another obstacle the builders faced when trying to dock the dirigibles on the Empire State Building was nature. The winds at the top of the Empire State Building were constantly shifting which would cause the blimp to be very unstable. The blimp is usually weighted down by lead weights but in New York this would not be safe because they would be dangling above pedestrians. The many obstacles faced by the architects caused the docking of the blimps to be unsuccessful. Ultimately, the combination of structural concerns, safety hazards, and unpredictable weather conditions led to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan."
729	15562	6	3	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. Some of these obstacles included the fact that there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This made it impossible for a ship to be tied to the building because it would be illegal. Also, in line three of paragraph thirteen, it is stated that it would have been unsafe because many dirigibles from other countries used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen, being very flammable would put people not only inside of the dirigibles, but everyone near and around it, in great danger. Another obstacle mentioned in the excerpt, perhaps the largest one, was the violent air currents causing wind at the top of the building to always be shifting, making it nearly impossible and unsafe for them to land there. Overall, the excerpt has made it clear that the only sensible way for dirigibles to land would be in an open field, free from the constraints and hazards posed by the building's height and the city's environment."
730	15563	6	3	To allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was difficult. For example, the mast was really hard to build. The engineers and architects needed to think about how to do it and ensure passengers' safety. First of all, dirigibles are heavy. Hydrogen might make it broken. Nobody knew what would happen when dirigibles fly in the sky. The body of the dirigible could swing in the wind, perhaps out of control. Which floor to put the mast was also really important, considering weight distribution. I think no one would like to work under the huge heavy dirigibles, given the potential risks. Therefore, the plan presented considerable challenges that required careful consideration.
731	15564	6	3	Some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were significant. In paragraph @NUM1, the architects were seemingly blind to the potential problems of the mast because most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, posing an unacceptable risk of explosion in the heart of New York City. Second, in paragraph @NUM2 the greatest obstacle to this successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself; the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making it nearly impossible for a dirigible to safely and accurately moor. Third, in paragraph @NUM3, the other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, further complicating the feasibility of docking. This is why the mooring mast for dirigibles was never completed, due to these serious obstacles that ultimately made the concept impractical for the Empire State Building.
732	15565	6	3	The builders had many obstacles to face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. During the 1920's and 1930's dirigibles were a big thing in transportation. The problem was that there wasn't many landing areas for the dirigibles to land because they were so big. So Al Smith came up with an idea to make a landing dock on top of the Empire State Building for the dirigibles. The government had to go over Al Smith's plan to make sure it was safe and would work. Al Smith's plan was to have the dirigibles hang onto the building by a single tether wire. It wouldnt be alowed because the dirigibles hanging from the wire would cause to much stress to the building. It was also not possible to have dirigibles to land on the Empire State building because the hydrogen and the dirigibles would be a safety hazard. The hydrogen in the dirigibles could catch on fire and burn the Empire State building down, thus the impracticality and danger led to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan.
733	15566	6	3	"The owners of the Empire State Building faced quite a few obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast. One of the first obstacles they faced was having to modify and strengthen the steel frame. This was essential in order for the building to be able to support the mooring mast where the dirigibles were supposed to dock, adding considerable cost and effort to the construction. Another great concern was safety; they feared an accident similar to the Hindenburg and thought of ""how much worse the accident could have been (paragraph @NUM1) if it had occurred in a city like New York,"" with its dense population and towering buildings. The greatest obstacle they faced, however, was nature. The violent air currents caused the wind to constantly shift, which would cause the docked aircrafts to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (paragraph @NUM2), making passenger transfer dangerous and impractical. A law which prevented airships from flying too low also made this dream a great fear to overcome, further complicating the situation. This prohibited them from not only docking there, but even approaching the area safely. Although this dream may have seemed possible to begin with, the builders should have realized the many obstacles, both structural and environmental, making their dreams quite impossible."
734	15567	6	3	Obstacles builders faced in constructing the Empire State Building to allow the attempt of a dirigible to dock were blind. The tug and pull of the unforecast wind made the dock dangerous for passengers and the building's foundation. However, making such attempts were illegal for dirigibles to fly over urban areas in case of failure. Spires as well made the drop impossible for them to approach, also in case of puncture. Spending sixty thousand on modifications to a mooring mast on the Empire State Building for the safe dock of dirigibles proved futile. The idea was ultimately lost to the creation of the modern new airplane, rendering the dirigible docking station obsolete.
735	15568	6	3	Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were numerous. The use of hydrogen rather than helium was a significant concern because hydrogen is highly flammable. The obstacles of it was nature itself. There's always strong and dangerous winds on top of the building. So it makes it possible for the dirigible to swivel around which is dangerous. Dirigibles moored in the open landing fields could be weighed down but, using these at the Empire State Building can dangling high above pedestrians which is not safe. Another reason is the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. If the dirigible blows, the sharp spires of the building can puncture the dirigible's shell, which presented a serious safety hazard. These challenges ultimately proved insurmountable, making the ambitious dirigible docking plan impractical.
736	15569	6	3	"The excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon discusses the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced to allow dirigibles to dock there. One example is one paragraph ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. This presented a considerable challenge, as the entire mooring concept depended on dirigibles being able to safely and legally navigate to and connect with the mast. Overcoming such legal hurdles was a crucial step in making the ambitious vision of aerial docking a reality, demonstrating the complex interplay between technological innovation and existing regulations."
737	15570	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was a mooring mast would add too much stress to the building's frame. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation, a costly and time-consuming endeavor. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making docking a dangerous proposition. There was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, posing legal challenges. These issues ultimately proved insurmountable, and the dirigible docking plan was abandoned.
738	15571	6	3	They had problems with the dirigibles trying to land it there. The dirigible's large size made maneuvering difficult. The dirigible could have caught fire due to static electricity or flammable gases, and it would have been worse. It was dangerous to attach piece to the part, especially in those conditions. The high wind was a problem, making the landing even more precarious. The dirigible could burn up mid-air or fall down during the landing attempt, and people would die below. These factors combined to create a very hazardous situation.
739	15572	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a lot of problems when trying to create a dock for dirigibles. The builders could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. They had to think about how the dirigible would fare, they had to strengthen the foundation of the building, and create a landing area for the dirigible. Dirigibles were to dock by means of an electric winch. The problem with this is they were in Downtown New York, and New York City was a densely populated area. A dirigible floating in the middle of a largely populated area would be very unsafe. Also, a dirigible is made of hydrogen and helium, and hydrogen is very flammable. So, if an accident happened and a dirigible was destroyed, people below would be in danger. Another obstacle was the law: airships cannot fly too low over urban areas. The greatest obstacle of them all, though, was nature itself; the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This idea sounded great at first, but too many things could go wrong, rendering the concept ultimately impractical and dangerous.
740	15573	6	3	When the Empire State Building was being constructed, the main idea was to create a mooring mast for dirigibles (blimps) to dock there. However, being the first of its kind, this idea came with many obstacles. Before constructing the mast, they had to stabilize the building with steel framework and other modifications as stated in paragraph nine. Dirigibles are very long, and the previous structure would not be enough to support it with the high blowing winds. Safety was also an issue with adding the mooring mast. Blimps from outside the United States were filled with hydrogen, which is extremely flammable, instead of helium. If something were to happen, and the blimp caught fire, that could threaten the safety of civilians. There were also concerns about the practicality of passengers disembarking at such a height, and how they would safely reach the ground. After the mast was constructed, the high speed winds were an obstacle yet again, and they wouldn't even allow dirigibles to come close to the building. Despite how unique the idea of letting dirigibles dock on the Empire State Building was, there were many obstacles getting in the way of making the idea successful.
741	15574	6	3	"While in the process of building the Empire State Building, @ORGANIZATION1 encountered many obstacles. His first obstacle was the threat of title for world's tallest building being taken away by the Chrysler Building, when the architect added a 185-foot spiral to the top of the building. Al Smith had to come up with an innovative way to add height to the building. This is when the idea of adding a mooring mast to the top of the building was composed and the real problems arose. When building this mooring mast, the docking of dirigibles would add intense stress to the framework of the building. ""The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. (paragraph @NUM1) ""The architects would add @NUM2 dollars worth of modifications to the framework to allow it to be stable. After the building was able to accommodate dirigibles safety issues would be encountered. First off, dirigibles are filled with hydrogen which is extremely flammable, and after the Hindenburg disaster in New Jersey, they did not want to take a chance. Next, with the wind above the building the air currents would cause violent shifts of the dirigibles. The addition of weights, used in other situations, was out of the question because they would be dangling high above pedestrians. Lastly there is an existing regulation that airships cannot fly too low over urban areas, which this would clearly violate. With all these obstacles to overcome, the idea of docking dirigibles on this mast was shortly discarded, proving to be an impractical endeavor due to safety concerns and logistical impossibilities."
742	15575	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building were faced with a multitude of problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, the building frame had to be strengthened. The weight of ""the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" This meant that the building's frame had to be modified, which costed $2 million dollars. Next, it proved too dangerous to dock dirigibles to the sumptuous sky-scraper. After the Hindenburg caught fire, ""the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area."" In accordance with this danger, there was a lot existing at the time which prohibited dirigibles from flying low over urban areas. Lastly, the largest obstacle engineers tried to overcome was simply nature itself. Winds at the top of the building made dirigibles almost impossible to land. Both the Columbia and the Los Angeles tried to dock to the mast but could not battle the wind. In conclusion, despite the costly reinforcement and the initial vision, the builders of the Empire State Building could not get a dirigible to dock at their tower due to a combination of safety concerns and uncontrollable environmental factors."
743	15576	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem they encountered was that when moored at the top of the building the dirigible would add stress to the buildings frame. The builders would then have to ""modify and strengthen the empire state building to this new situation"" to accommodate the immense weight and pull. Another obstacle the builders would have to face is that since a dirigible used hydrogen it would be highly flammable, posing a significant risk. The builders didn't want an ""accident to take place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York,"" fearing catastrophic consequences. Lastly builders would have to face the obstacle of Nature. With winds so strong up top the building the dirigibles would need to be weighted down in back with lead weights which would be neither safe nor practical dangling high above pedestrians in New York City. In conclusion, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted shows that the builders faced many difficulties in their ambitious plan to have dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building."
744	15577	6	3	"The obstacles the builder of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was difficult. The builder met with experts to better understand the way the dirigibles work. He also was told that architects couldn't put a mooring mast on top because of the building's flat roof. Paragraph nine states, ""a thousand-foot dirigible- held by a single cable tether would add stress to the building's frame."" The stress would then be passed all the way down to the building's foundation, nearly eleven hundred feet below. The builder put over sixty thousand dollars' worth of changes into the building. After all that time and money he was told that the plan would have to fall through. The dirigibles' greatest obstacle was the wind; if it moved in the air that could be a problem. Thus, despite the effort and resources invested, the docking plan ultimately proved unfeasible. Although this plan didn't work, it's still 1,250 ft and taller than the Chrysler building."
745	15578	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast,"" a historical article by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, it is made clear that there were at least three obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in an attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. These issues were the building's pre-existing frame, fire safety, and nature itself. The plans for the Empire State Building had not intended a mooring mast to be dropped on the roof of the building. As a result, architects had to change their entire plan: ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation,"" (par. @NUM1). This was a significant difficulty, requiring considerable redesign and additional materials. Also a concern for foreign dirigibles was that the gas the use made fire safety and issue: ""... the owners... realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area,"" (par. @NUM2). The Hindenburg disaster loomed large in the public consciousness, raising serious concerns about the safety of lighter-than-air craft. Getting around the fire hazard would be impossible. Finally, as stated in the article, nature was the mast's greatest obstacle. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" (par. @NUM3). The violent winds kept much from happening with the mast, rendering docking maneuvers exceedingly dangerous, if not impossible. With the three aforementioned obstacles, the fate of the Empire State Building's mooring mast was grim. It would never do what Al Smith had intended for it, and the grand vision of aerial docking quickly faded."
746	15579	6	3	The lack of a suitable landing area posed a significant challenge for dirigible operations at the Empire State Building. Also, the body of the dirigible's tendency to swing in the wind was another obstacle. Furthermore, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The dirigibles were also flying too low over urban areas, which violated existing airship regulations. A dirigible from Los Angeles could not get close enough to tie up because of the wind conditions. Ultimately, a multitude of issues plagued passenger transport, leading to the cessation of these services.
747	15580	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph @NUM1 the author States ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the @ORGANIZATION2 ing's flat roof."" This was true because it would ""add stress to the building's frame."" Also paragraph @NUM2 states ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" There were violent air currents, and landing techniques weren't promising, particularly with the strong winds often present at that altitude. The builders had to use much caution because the idea of having a dirigible land at that height was neither practical nor safe, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the ambitious mooring mast concept."
748	15581	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" the builders faced many obstacles. The main issue that was not noticed till the end; was that it was an enormous safety problem. The builders wanted to make the mooring mast a docking point for dirigibles, blimps, and zeppelins from the country and from other countries, but other countries used hydrogen, rather than helium; and hydrogen is extremely flammable. A fire over a metropolis such as New York would be catastrophic! Also, dirigibles used large lead weights to weigh them down. Using them in a city dangling over pedestrians would be neither practical, nor safe. Thus, what initially seemed like a marvel of engineering was, upon closer inspection, fraught with peril, rendering the mooring mast's viability questionable."
749	15582	6	3	"The invention of the mass on top of the Empire State Building was an undeveloped idea that created a new means of transportation but arrived with numerous flaws. One obstacle the engineers faced was resting a one thousand foot dirigible over a twelve hundred fifty foot building because with combined wind pressure this would put stress on the building's structure and allow it to collapse. This transportation was also extremely dangerous to the public because many foreign dirigibles ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable (paragraph @NUM1)."" Not only this, if builders ever allowed dirigibles to dock on the building, the back of the airship would spin around the mooring mast due to shifting violent air currents as stated in paragraph @NUM2. Also, the speed of the airship had to be slow in order for it to dock, which can be time-consuming. In paragraph @NUM3, it says that an existing law would prohibit airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made docking dirigibles atop of the Empire State Building illegal because dirigibles would be above the people which was against the laws. All of these obstacles made the transportations a failure and as a result the use of the mast had disappeared."
750	15583	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building went through many difficult obstacles trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the difficult obstacles the builders went through is that the winds on top of the building were always shifting. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting do to violent air currents."" This quote is describing how bad the winds were and how it made it difficult for the builders to work, especially when maneuvering a large airship. To solve that problem, the builders could have weighed down the back with lead; but that would cause it to be dangling high above pedestrians on the street which isn't safe. ""But using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was not safe."" This quote is explaining how using lead would not be safe, posing a risk of falling debris. Another problem is that it is illegal for airships to fly too low to urban areas. ""@CAPS1 an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas."" This quote explains the law about airships, which further complicated the docking attempts. Clearly, the builders had many difficult obstacles to overcome in their ambitious dirigible docking plan."
751	15584	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was installing the mooring mast; the architects couldn't simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof because the weight of the blimp moored at the top held by a single cable tether would add stress to the frame. The stress of the dirigibles load and wind pressure would transmit all the way to the building's foundation. The builders would have to modify and strengthen the building to accommodate the new situation. Another obstacle they faced was the cost, because it would take over sixty thousand dollars to make the proper modifications to the building's framework. Also safety was another major obstacle; they would have to make people safe, because most dirigibles from other countries used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The areas were densely populated, and an accident over the city would be much worse. The greatest obstacle was nature itself, but winds on the building were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents; even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back would swivel around. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down by weights, but using these would be dangerous dangling that high above pedestrians. Many obstacles were practical reasons why they couldn't moor at the Empire State Building. There was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas and making it illegal for ships to tie up to the building. So long as these obstacles were faced in attempting to allow docking, the dream of using the Empire State Building as a dirigible port remained unrealized.
752	15585	6	3	Based on this excerpt the builders faced a few problems when building the Empire State Building. One problem was actually docking the Zeppelins or dirigibles. The wind was vicious at 1,250 ft in the air. Another problem the builders faced was with safety, specifically fire safety. Since most dirigibles from outside the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium it was a fire safety issue. This concern only increased after the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by a fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, effectively ending the dirigible docking plan.
753	15586	6	3	"In the story ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders needed more support for the building's framework. They had to use over sixty thousand dollars to buy correct modification. Lack of a suitable landing area. There are alot of obstacles for the dirigibles. The builders needed more support for the building's framework because ""a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame"" (@ORGANIZATION2, para @NUM1). They had to use over sixty thousand dollars to buy modifications for the stressed frame, as ""over sixty-thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"" (@ORGANIZATION2, para @NUM1). There was a lack of suitable landing area, since ""the one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area"" (@ORGANIZATION2, para 6). These structural and logistical challenges ultimately underscored the impracticality of the mooring mast concept. In the story ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, this is how the builders of the Empire State building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."
754	15587	6	3	"In the excerpt from @ORGANIZATION2's The Mooring Mast, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. For example, ""the lack of a suitable landing area"" posed a considerable challenge. Architects cannot just drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's roof without considering the ramifications. The building would have had an extreme amount of pressure on it from the weight and forces involved. In addition, along with the pressure, the dirigibles would ""add stress to the building's frame,"" potentially compromising its structural integrity. The builders needed to modify and strengthen the steel frame of the Empire State Building to withstand these new loads. This also cost a great deal of money, adding to the project's financial burden. Furthermore, ""the greatest reason was safety,"" as the mooring of large airships high above the city presented significant risks. The slightest mistake in building the mast, or in the docking procedure, could affect every person in the building and those nearby. In order to allow dirigibles to dock there, the builders needed to be aware of all the citizens surrounding the building and the potential dangers they faced. All in all, these obstacles, from structural concerns to financial costs and safety implications, ultimately determined the fate of the mast and its limited use."
755	15588	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, it was illegal to have an aircraft flying too close to a city, as there ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". Another obstacle was the building's structure; if the blimp had docked, there would be stress on the building, which ""would add stress to the building's Frame"". The last obstacle was the wind, which would push the blimp around every which way when docked on the tower, because ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". These challenges ultimately made the impractical idea of dirigible docking unfeasible."
756	15589	6	3	The mooring mast on the Empire State Building was intentionally built for dirigible docking. Although the problem with allowing that to happen was not questioned at the time of the mast's construction, safety issues were a major concern. Most dirigibles from outside the U.S. used hydrogen gas, which is extremely flamable. The news of the German dirigible Hindenburg being destroyed in flames greatly concerned the owners of the Empire State Building. They imagined how much worse that would be if a dirigible combusted on the building and in a dense population of Downtown New York. The potential for catastrophic loss of life and property was simply too great. This caused the builders of the Empire State Building to reconsider allowing dirigibles to dock at its mooring mast, ultimately abandoning the original purpose of the structure.
757	15590	6	3	Throughout the story workers of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacles they faced was trying to get a thousand-foot dirigible mooring at the top of the building. This mooring was held together by a single cable tether and that would add stress to the building's frame. All the dirigible's load and wind pressure had to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, but that was eleven hundred feet below. Another obstacle is that the hydrogen in the dirigible was highly flammable, posing a significant safety risk. If a dirigible was ever destroyed it would kill a lot of people because the Empire State Building is in downtown New York. The greatest obstacle was that the winds at the top of the building were constantly changing so would be very difficult to land. The last obstacle was it was against the law for airships to fly too low in urban areas, further complicating the already challenging docking process. Ultimately, these numerous and complex problems made the dirigible docking idea impractical.
758	15591	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there included the fact that he realized he was close to losing the title of world's tallest building, and some of his opinions were proven wrong because of facts discovered during the planning and construction. Another obstacle was trying to accomplish everything he said he was going to do on time, requiring a more realistic approach than initially envisioned. Most obstacles had to do with ""nature itself,"" particularly the wind, which would make a moored dirigible swivel around dangerously, making the entire concept impractical and ultimately leading to its abandonment."
759	15592	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Popular Mechanics, it explains how the developing idea of landing a dirigible on the Empire State Building was eventually rejected due to many obstacles. The first design flaw that the engineers considered was the stress the dirigible would add to the building's frame. A mass that size attached to the building by a single cable tether would be tremendous in the building's foundation. The greatest obstacle the engineers considered in allowing dirigibles to dock was safety. With the use of hydrogen, the dirigibles are highly flammable. This would have created a dangerous situation over a ""densely populated area such as downtown New York"". The final obstacle the builders considered was the wind. The winds at that height were extremely strong. Chapter One it says, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This would create a dangerous situation for the ship's passengers. In ""The Mooring Mast"", it described how it would be nearly impossible to land dirigibles atop the Empire State Building."
760	15593	6	3	"The Mooring Mast, authored by @PERSON1, presents two main obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. The first problem was the uncontrollable factor of mother nature. With high speed air currents would cause ""the back of the ship to swivel around and around the mooring mast."" If the dirigible was unable to dock correctly, the dangers would be the fact it was ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street, (which) was neither practical nor safe."" This made the entire concept of docking a risky proposition. Another problem the builders encountered was the already existing law that made sure airships don't fly too low over cities. The author notes, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" Because of mother nature and pre-existing legislature, the builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome enigmatic problems, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan."
761	15594	6	3	Based on the excerpt, there were a few obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced. One of the obstacles was that there was a lack of a suitable landing area. The second obstacle was that in order to have a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building they would have to spend sixty thousand dollars just to accommodate the new station. Another obstacle being dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building due to the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. These three obstacles made it difficult for dirigibles to take over the future. That is why we now have airplanes dominating air travel.
762	15595	6	3	"There were many obstacles facing the builders attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the mast of the Empire State Building. One reason was that attaching a humongous blimp to the peak of the building would add excessive strain to it. Lusted explains: ""A thousand-foot dirgible moored at the top of the building... would add stress to the building's frame."" Much revision to the structure's frame was needed, as the building was originally designed without such a massive, dynamic load in mind. Another obstacle was nature. Wind currents would push the dirigible around and it would be very unsafe. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This would make it unsafe for passengers to get on or off the blimp, as a constantly rotating airship would present a dangerous moving target. There was also a law in effect that prevented ""airships flying too low over urban areas."" These obstacles prevented the builders from safely devising a way to dock the dirigibles, ultimately rendering the ambitious plan impractical and unfeasible."
763	15596	6	3	Allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was never possible because of the obstacles that the architects faced. First, nature was against the builders. The strong winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting, which proved a hazard to dirigibles attempting to moor. Mooring dirigibles with weights was out of the question because dropped weights posed a danger to pedestrians below. Another obstacle was an already existing law that prohibited dirigibles from flying low over urban areas. This law effectively made it illegal for a dirigible to dock at the Empire State Building, given the building's location. The final obstacle was the ever-present risk that a dirigible could be accidentally ignited and fall on New York. The destruction of the Hindenburg, with its tragic consequences, made clear that it was not possible to have a dirigible dock at the Empire State Building without risking a similar catastrophe, thus rendering the entire project infeasible.
764	15597	6	3	"Architects for the Empire State Building faced many problems trying install the landing gear on the mooring mast. There were many safety issues to get around landing a dirigible or blimp on the building. People in a populated area such as New York City, is not the safest place to land a blimp, ""when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as dowtown New York."" They could not take this risk, and the public relations disaster from such an event would be catastrophic. So, the competion for landing gear was called off. Another main cause was the wind current on top of the Empire State Building. It proved very difficult to keep a blimp level at high altitudes, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This could potentially result in the blimp detaching and hitting other buildings, or even plummeting to the streets below. This is why landing blimps on the Empire State building would be dangerous and difficult, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the ambitious plan."
765	15598	6	3	"""The Mooring Mast"", by @ORGANIZATION1, details how workers and builders try to create a docking area for Dirigibles (blimps). In the process, they @CAPS1 encountered many obstacles. First, the obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing area; it really should've been made bigger initially. Workers did work, but it wasn't enough. The greatest obstacle was nature itself; good builders should know that wind is rougher at higher altitudes. Basically, they should have thought things through more thoroughly. Lastly, there was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas; they should have checked for existing regulations. Also, all that work ended up being for nothing. All these obstacles that the workers and builders @CAPS2 faced were preventable, meaning money and time wouldn't have been wasted, ultimately illustrating the importance of foresight and planning in large-scale construction projects."
766	15599	6	3	"In the excerpt 'The Mooring Mast' by @ORGANIZATION2, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock here are evident. One example of this is ""The Obstacle to their expanded use into New York City was lack of a suitable landing area"". This shows that the mooring mast is going to be a problem because of the lack of a suitable landing area, meaning it's too difficult for landing, it's not meant for docking. Another example is 'A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether would add stress to the building frame.' This shows that the building is not stable enough for landing. For a final example ""The greatest obstacles to the successful use of a mooring mast was nature itself.' This highlights the unpredictable nature of weather, which would invariably affect landing attempts, making docking unreliable. These examples show how in the excerpt 'The Mooring Mast' by @ORGANIZATION2, the obstacles that the builders faced ultimately made the dirigible docking plan impractical."
767	15600	6	3	"The use of the mast on the Empire State Building for dirigibles faced many obstacles. Violent winds, the amount of structural support and anti low-flying aircraft laws made it impossible to use. The high winds would spin the back of the aircraft and therefore the entire dirigible around the spire, and the structural support of such was extremely risky, requiring extensive and costly reinforcement. The main interfering point however was an, ""existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas. This would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"". This combination of practical difficulties and legal restrictions inevitably lead to the mast not being put to use for its originally intended purpose."
768	15601	6	3	"The obstacle the builders had in attempting to allow dirigibles or ""blimps"" to dock on the Empire State Building were nature itself. The reason nature is the obstacle for blimps to dock on the building is because the wind currents moving the end of the blimp. If the blimp is moving by the wind while passangers are leaving or getting in, it would be very easy to fall off. Another obstacle the builders had with docking the blimps is the lead weights dangling from the end of the blimps. Those weights were used to keep the blimp from shifting directions due to the wind currents but it was a concern for the safety of the Street Pedestrians. On page 1 of ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, it quotes that ""... that using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above Pedestrians on the Street, was neither practical nor safe"". This quote proves that putting weights on the back of the blimp would be dangerous because if they some how fall off then someone could get really hurt on the streets, thus proving that the natural elements and safety concerns ultimately made the blimp docking idea unfeasible."
769	15602	6	3	Building docks for dirigibles to land on the Empire State Building was a real challenge for Al Smith. The Steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be strengthened because the dirigible's load and wind pressure would put too much stress on the building's frame. The dirigibles were highly flammable, and that put a huge risk in safety for the workers in the building and the people on the street. The dirigible's movements could not be monitored due to violent air currents at the top of the building. The main reason why the docks for dirigibles did not work was because of the law against airships. The law did not allow airships to fly low over urban areas, effectively making the docking plan impossible to execute legally. The invention of docks for dirigibles on the Empire State Building was unrealistic and unsafe, ultimately proving to be an impractical venture due to a combination of structural, safety, and legal hurdles.
770	15603	6	3	"In ""The @CAPS1 Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, which made it very difficult to make this project workable. The workers faced safety problems due to chemicals and certain gasses. ""Most durigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (Amidon L¸sted ∂ @NUM1 lines @NUM2 + @NUM3) This created the potential for explosions and fire hazards. ""The owners of the Empire State Building realised how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" (Amidon L¸sted ∂ @NUM1 lines @NUM5). The greatest obstacle to their successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents. In the excerpt ""The @CAPS1 Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in which they could not control, particularly the unpredictable and powerful winds at such a great height, demonstrating that even the most ambitious engineering feats can be thwarted by the forces of nature."
771	15604	6	3	Some obstacles that the Empire State builders had while creating the Empire State Building included dealing with fast winds. This was because the giant needle that was built on top of the building was waving back and forth, which made it harder to keep in place. Another obstacle would be attempting to bring dirigibles or blimps towards the giant needle; a puncture to the blimp would have been extremely dangerous, as it was only made of cotton fabric, making the entire endeavor quite risky.
772	15605	6	3	"Based on the excerpt there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle the builders faced was the dirigibles were too big and could be dangerous. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" This shows that it will be harder to build the mast than expected. Another obstacle the builders ran into was that the building would have to be modified. ""The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" The biggest obstacle the builders faced is that it wasn't safe. ""Most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION1 used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable,"" which posed a significant risk. Clearly, these obstacles contributed to the ultimate abandonment of the dirigible docking idea."
773	15606	6	3	"In the short story ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example they needed a suitable landing area which they could not do very easily. They needed to put a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, but the architects could not do that with no problem. It took a lot of work. The @CAPS1 says ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" @CAPS2 the initial idea to add the mooring mast, would add stress to the building and potentially take it down. The wind pressure had a great deal on that also, as the high winds were making it hard to keep the Dirigibles stable during the docking process. They wanted to add weights to hold the airships down, but that wouldn't be good for the people below. The @CAPS1 says ""Could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" Ultimately, the mooring mast idea was plagued with too many problems to overcome, hindering its success."
774	15607	6	3	"This dream of the aviation pioneers was travel by dirigible was a dream that would be hard-to-reach. The architects and engineers that attempted to establish a mooring mast had high hopes, including meeting with the president. ""Held by a single cable tether"" would not be stable enough to mount the dirigible because the building frame would be stress to too much. What if they were to do this, the Empire State Building have to be modified and strengthened to adapt to the new placement of the dirigible. But instead the architects assigned a ""shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower"" and then designed the mooring mast. However, before the mooring mast could be complete, the roof had to be completed before the mooring mast could fit in its position most of portly the main problem with the mooring mast was nature. Nature could easily mess up the mooring mast, due to winds, which would cause the shifting of the dirigible. Also due to a ""law against airships flying too low"" the dirigible would break that law as well. The whole attempt to make a mooring mast slowly deteriorated because of all the obstacles, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the project."
775	15608	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building had a lot of struggles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, they had to consult with experts to see if the equipment was safe enough. They took tours of the equipment and mooring operations at the Naval Air Station at Lakehurst, New Jersey. Next, they had a hard time dropping the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. They would have to use $500,000 worth of modifications to strengthen the building's framework. They were never going to have this happen in the first place, because of the safety issue, the hydrogen gas in the dirigible is highly flammable. The biggest issue though, was nature. The winds on top of the building made it very hard to work, and it got very violent. Ultimately, these challenges proved too significant to overcome, and the dirigible docking plan was abandoned.
776	15609	6	3	The builders had many obstacles in their way to accomplish their idea of docking dirigibles. One main problem was that most dirigibles around the world used hydrogen gas, which is highly flammable, which can make things very dangerous at such an altitude, especially considering the potential for static electricity. The greatest obstacle to its success was nature itself. The winds where the docking would occur were constantly shifting, and this would make the stability of the dirigible very difficult with the back end stretching so far away from the tower, potentially leading to dangerous swaying. Another reason this wouldn't work was because of an already existing law against air ships flying so low over urban areas, further complicating the practicality and legality of the docking procedure. Ultimately, these converging factors presented substantial challenges to realizing the dirigible docking vision.
777	15610	6	3	"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced were all due to the addition of the mooring mast. First, the architects had to modify the steel frame of the Empire State Building. The architects knew that the large mooring mass could not be simply placed on the building's flat roof. Marcia Amidon L¸sted explains that ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building frame"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). Because the building needed to adapt to the situation, they spent over @MONEY1 to modify the framework, adding considerable cost to the project. Another obstacle that the builders of the Empire State Building had to face were the safety issues of the new mooring mast. These concerns about the safety arose from an incident when the Hindenburg, a German dirigible, was destroyed by fire at Lakehurst, New Jersey. Because the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium, the risks were higher, as hydrogen is more flammable. L¸sted writes ""the owners of the Empire State realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" (L¸sted @NUM2). The Empire State Building was just an impractical location for an airship dock, as the strong winds at that altitude made docking incredibly difficult and dangerous. Finally, by the late 1930s, it was certain that the mooring mass would not fulfill its purpose because dirigibles had now given way to airplanes, rendering the expensive and complex mooring mast obsolete."
778	15611	6	3	The builders that constructed The Empire State Building faced many obstacles when they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. Most importantly they could not just simply drop a mooring mast atop the building and hope for the best. The mast would add a large amount of stress to the framework, also factor in the stress of the dirigibles load and wind pressure, and the framework would need to be modified and strengthened to withstand these new forces. Safety was also a key problem the builders ran into. Most dirigibles were highly flammable due to their hydrogen inflation, and to have them fly over such a populated city as New York would be impractical, presenting a significant fire hazard. As well as their flammable characteristic there was also a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. So therefore it was illegal to tie up, or even approach the building. The last obstacle the builders ran into was the wind. The winds at that height were constantly shifting due to the violent currents. There was also the fear that the wind would blow the ships into the sharp spires of another building, causing catastrophic damage. Including all of the obstacles, and the eventual loss of interest in dirigibles as a viable form of transportation, was the ultimate result in the discontinuation of the ambitious docking project.
779	15612	6	3	"New technology, especially in aviation, requires work to be done, thus causing many obstacles to overcome. In order to make this mooring mast on the Empire State building a success, the builders would need to know how to keep the dirigible hooked to the building and able to set passengers on and off. A quote from the text supporting this would be ""A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on"". (6). But the passengers were not the only obstacle the builders had to surpass. The stress a dirigible would put on the building would be too great, meaning they also had to remodel the actual building. The text supports this with, ""the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" (@NUM1). Even with all these modifications, however, the mooring mast was doomed to failure for reasons the builders could not fix. The unpredictable and often severe weather conditions at that height made docking a dirigible incredibly dangerous and impractical, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the project."
780	15613	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, obstacles for the builders of the Empire State Building were presented because dirigibles were to dock there. The first obstacle was safety because most dirigibles from outside of the Europe were filled with hydrogen which is very flammable compared to helium. The builders were concerned because on May 6, 1937 the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire, since it was filled by hydrogen, in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The second obstacle was nature: ""The winds... were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast"" (paragraph 6). This meant that passengers could not get off safely and the dirigible could hit anything in the vicinity if swung a wrong way. The last obstacle was an existing law against airships fly too low over urban areas which means that it was illegal for a ship to tie up to a building or approach the area. Therefore, the builders of the Empire State Building who attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there were presented many obstacles as shown by the excerpt, The Mooring Mast."
781	15614	6	3	Some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced to allow dirigibles to moor there were, the framing of the building and the height of the building and where passengers would land and dock. The frame of the building was important because if a thousand feet dirigible were to moor at the top of the building, it could add stress to the building's structure and frame and transfer it all down to the building's foundation. Wind pressure and directional change would also push the dirigible according adding more stress to the building. This meant the steel framework had to be reinforced to withstand the immense forces. The building was at first designed to be @NUM1 floors, but to allow a dirigible to dock there and the load and unload passengers it needed more room and more height The building needed an observation room and a boarding area. When the building was redesigned the building reached to 102 floors and on the 101st floor it was an observation room doubled as a boarding area. The builders of the Empire State Building had many obstacles for the design of the attempt to allow dirigibles to moor on the roof including adding height to the building. The foremost problem though, was the framing of the building, and resolving this issue was paramount to the project's structural integrity. It needed to be strengthened and in doing so it would allow a dirigible to moor on the top with no issues to the structure of the building, ultimately ensuring the safety and stability of the iconic skyscraper.
782	15615	6	3	"Competitive architect Al Smith wanted the Empire State Building to be the tallest most unique building. ""Their top, they said, would serve a higher calling"" (@NUM1). The Building was supporting the age of transportation by dirigible. Al Smith commented ""It's on the level, all right. No kidding. We're working on the thing now"" (@NUM2). In reality the architects were blind to the potential problems of the mast. There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One great reason was safety, particularly concerning the highly flammable nature of hydrogen. If any dirigibles from outside the United States used to the mast it could be highly flammable due to using hydrogen rather helium. Another reason was nature itself. Shifting winds due to violent air currents made it dangerous as the back of the ship would twist around the mooring mast. Most importantly an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. That law would then make it illegal for a ship to ever tied to a building. By the late 1930s dirigibles, instead of becoming the transportation of the future, had given way to airplanes, rendering the mooring mast's original purpose obsolete."
783	15616	6	3	Based on the excerpt the builders faced many hard tasks. The builders had to make sure that the mooring mast was stable enough to dock there. They also had to add on more floors on the Empire State building because the original Chrysler building added another 46 feet to still be the tallest building. Now the architects had to had the 85th floor plus the mooring mast, this brought the Empire State building to a total of 1,250 feet. The reason that a mooring mast failed was because the dirigible highly flamable and in a highly populated area like New York it would be tragic. Also nature itself with the wind were violent air current. This would cause the back of the dirigible to move around the mooring mast. These challenges ultimately proved too great, revealing the impracticality of mooring dirigibles to such a structure and concluding the mooring mast concept was ultimately a failure.
784	15617	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle being the safety of the people below on the streets. The excerpt in paragraph @NUM1 clearly states that it was dangerous because if the dirigible caught fire it would be ""Much worse if it had taken place above a densely populated area."" Another obstacle would be that there is a law stated in paragraph @NUM2 that says there is ""An existing law against air ships flying too low over urban areas."" This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area, further hindering the docking attempts. The greatest obstacle though was nature itself as stated in paragraph @NUM3: ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The wind would make the dirigible swivel around and around the mooring mast, making the docking process extremely hazardous. An idea came into plan that said ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights,"" but why not at the Empire State Building? Safety is the reason, because the weight on the building would be dangling above people on the street which would be unsafe. Moreover, flyers who approached the building would fear that the wind would blow the dirigible on to the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, posing an additional safety risk. These combined factors ultimately made the dirigible docking plan impractical and ultimately contributed to its failure."
785	15618	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are that dirigible use different gases to stay aloft. As stated in paragraph 6, the first obstacle the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building is ""To their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" From paragraph @NUM1 it states that if a mooring mast was to be dropped to the roof of the building and a single cable tether would add stress to the building, and pressure would cause them having to modify the building and framework, which cost over sixty thousand dollars. In other words, most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Also, from paragraph @NUM2 the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds would cause constantly shifting air currents. ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" This was further compounded by the fact that the mooring mast never worked and high winds made the prospect of docking on top of the skyscraper unrealistic and unsafe, sealing its fate as an unworkable solution."
786	15619	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the building. The architects could not just put the mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof. ""A dirigible would be held to the building by a single cable tether, which would add stress to the buildings frame."" (L¸sted @NUM1) The stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted down to the foundation. ""The building's steel frame would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" (L¸sted @NUM1) ""Over sixty thousand dollars of modifications would have to be made."" (L¸sted @NUM1) The building was based entirely around the mooring mast. New modifications were only used to support the blimp itself and not other factors like nature winds. These issues ultimately proved too difficult and costly to overcome, leading to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan."
787	15620	6	3	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the constructors of the Empire State building faced many difficulties while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In every building or project there must the certainty that it is safe for everyone and that there is no risk of harm. ""The greatest reason was one of safety. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Dirigibles, or blimps, were not safe in general at the time. If one burned down in the middle of the country, the death toll and cost to repair what was damaged wouldn't be as much as if it burned down in downtown New York City. The possibility of even a small accident involving a dirigible docking at the Empire State Building could have had devastating consequences, making any potential benefits of the mooring mast seem insignificant. One, if not the greatest, challenge the constructors of the Empire State was that landing flamable blimps over the middle of a city was a safety hazard which could potentially kill many people as well as destroy parts of the city. Therefore, the safety concerns surrounding flammable dirigibles ultimately proved to be a significant obstacle that was too great to overcome."
788	15621	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" written by @ORGANIZATION2, the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph @NUM1 under ""The Fate of the Mast"", the first line says ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. Strong winds due to violent air currents would make it impossible to dock a dirigible on the Empire State Building. The wind would blow the dirigible off the mast into New York City. The unpredictable and often severe weather conditions at that height posed a continuous threat. In paragraph @NUM2 under ""The Fate of the Mast"", a line states ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law made it illegal for dirigibles and other aircraft to even fly in such and urban area like New York. Such restrictions severely limited the feasibility of using the mast as intended. One final obstacle is safety precautions. In paragraph @NUM3 a line states, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium."" If a dirigible were to crash and it had this highly flammable gas it would create a massive disaster. The use of hydrogen, while providing greater lift, introduced an unacceptable level of risk to the densely populated city. Violent winds, laws, and safety precautions are all against the docking of dirigibles at the mooring mast. These considerable challenges ultimately rendered the mooring mast impractical for its original purpose."
789	15622	6	3	When designing the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building to dock dirigibles, the builders came across a few obstacles. A dirigible is a blimp filled with hydrogen and/or helium to keep it lightly in the air. What the builders did not realize ahead of time was that hydrogen is a highly flammable gas. If it docked on top of a building around movement it could easily catch fire, creating the whole building itself to blow up, which was a serious safety concern. Another obstacle that the builders noticed would occur was the forceful winds. With a dirigible dock so high up in the air, it creates an unstable way for people to get off of it. The vicious winds would make the back of the dirigible swivel around the mooring mast because only the front would be weighed down. The last obstacle that was found with docking a dirigible was that it would be too low to an urban area. The dirigible would be too close to walking pedestrians, creating an unsafe environment if something were to go wrong. Without taking that chance, it was agreed that there were too many obstacles; therefore, the idea of docking a dirigible on top of the Empire State Building was cancelled, as the risks outweighed any potential benefits.
790	15623	6	3	"In the construction of the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles they faced was having to make changes to the steel frame of the building in order to have the strength to accommodate the new situation. In paragraph @NUM1 it @CAPS2 that ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"", @CAPS1 this was a costly project as well. The excerpt also @CAPS2 that there were problems with getting the dirigible to stay in place without moving. The dirigible would be in a very windy area, and there was only one chord attached to the building which would leave the back moving around all over the place. Ultimately, the impracticality of docking dirigibles, combined with the expense and safety concerns, led to the abandonment of the project, demonstrating the challenges of adapting infrastructure to novel technologies."
791	15624	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" the builders faced the obstacles of safety, nature, and law in attempting to dock dirigibles atop the Empire State Building. First, it would not be safe. In the excerpt it stated, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen, rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" A spark could ignite the hydrogen and cause a deadly explosion. In a densely populated area such as New York, they couldn't risk having a dirigible burst into the flames and cause massive chaos. Second, nature would not agree. In the excerpt it stated, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Because of the winds in New York, the dirigible would not be secured well, and many dirigibles would be destroyed instead of held in place. Lastly, there was the reason of the law. It the excerpt it explained that, ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This was the most important reason of all. They could've taken risks on the other theories, but on this one they had no choice. They wouldn't be able to fight the law to allow dirigibles to fly that low. To conclude, the obstacles faced by the builders of safety, nature, and law could not be overcome to get the mast up and working."
792	15625	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges with docking airships; one of the most obvious reasons was the danger of docking at such high altitudes, especially considering the unpredictable weather conditions. If an accident occurred, like a fire, the entire area would be in danger, posing a significant risk to the city below. The modifications made to the building itself were already extensive enough, without needing any more additional, costly, and time-consuming work done. The most important reason would be maneuverability; the strong winds at that height made it difficult and almost impossible to control the blimp, never mind dock it safely and securely. Furthermore, @ORGANIZATION2 law even banned aircraft of any type flying so low over the city, effectively precluding any practical airship docking. Therefore, the airship docking idea was ultimately impractical and unsafe.
793	15626	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building were faced with obstacles in order to allow dirigibles to dock there. Safety was the main focus because New York is a densely populated area and many dirigibles were filled with highly flammable hydrogen. One problem was that the builders realized the dirigible would be hanging by a single cable tether which would add stress to the frame, so they would need to adjust the building and strengthen the frame. This cost over sixty thousand dollars to adjust. After that was taken care of, the builders still had other problems. Another problem the builders faced was that since the building was in a highly populated area, many pedestrians walk below where the dirigibles would be docked. The winds at the top would cause the dirigible to blow around, and lead weights could not be used because of the dangers of them falling. Thus, the developers had to consider numerous significant challenges in their attempt to turn the Empire State Building into an aerial docking station.
794	15627	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow Dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was when Al Smith realized that he was close to not winning the world's tallest building. It talks about it in paragraph @NUM1. Then he announced that the building would reach 1,250 feet. That's an obstacle because without the building he can't make the dirigible mooring mast a reality, and he always wanted competition, so his building had to be the winning one, and he had to build the dirigible mooring mast to solidify its status. This drive to be the tallest and most innovative created a challenging situation for the builders."
795	15628	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced problems to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some problems were that most dirigibles from other countries are filled with hydrogen, which is highly flammable; also, the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents and could cause the dirigible to wrap around the building. Another challenge the builders faced was an existing law against airships flying too low in urban areas, this law would make it illegal for the dirigible to even come near the building. They also had to spend a considerable amount of money to upgrade the framework so it does not put too much strain on the top of the building. Ultimately, these challenges proved insurmountable, and the dirigible docking station was abandoned, showing that some ambitious ideas are not always practical.
796	15629	6	3	"In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the architect and builders have to overcome very big obstacles while trying to make this plan of docking dirigibles work. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of this building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" With this enormous dirigible in the air and the wind blowing around would hurt the buildings structure. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. Engineers realized that the immense forces exerted by the airship required careful distribution of weight. With all of the wind the dirigible would be tugging back and forth on the building. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" To build a docking station the architects would have to transform the whole construction of the building. This involved reinforcing key structural components to ensure the building could withstand the additional strain, ultimately ensuring the safety and stability of the ambitious mooring project."
797	15630	6	3	Allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building came with a lot of obstacles to make it work. One obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Some dirigibles were as long as one thousand feet long which is equal to four city blocks in New York City. Another obstacle is they could not drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof. This would add stress to the building's frame and to dirigibles moored up there, making the entire endeavor structurally unsound and impractical to operate.
798	15631	6	3	"The workers on the Empire @CAPS1 Building ran into many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The workers ran into large problems with the safety of docking over a large city. Also, the reality of the construction and location was a future problem for the workers. The process was a troubling challenge overall. It was not very safe to have a large aircraft with passengers hanging over a large city. One percaution that was of great concern was that other dirigibles used hydrogen, ""and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The potential of having a fire over a city was a risk that they could not face, making passenger safety paramount. The dirigibles were not even allowed by law to get close enough to the Empire State Building to dock, further complicating matters. The workers had to face reality when it came to the construction and location. The mast was so high up that dirigibles would not be able to dock because of ""violent air currents."" Some blimps did not even have the proper ""mooring equipment installed."" The project al ltogether was unrealistic so therefor it was a great challenge for workers docking dirigibles. Ultimately, the combination of safety concerns, legal restrictions, and practical limitations due to weather and equipment rendered the docking project an insurmountable hurdle."
799	15632	6	3	The builders had a tough obstacle Because They in NYC were tryn to Erect A overall great Building. And were tryn to compete. The Dirigibles were A vital part in Building The empire State Building Because They were faced with obstacles That were hard like weather, wind, Height and ext. These were the challenges. On Dirigibles to land There were The Dirigibles were not heavy so They couldn't land as well And It was made with light mater ials. These are The reasons why This happens, explaining the difficulties faced during the construction.
800	15633	6	3	"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced were nature and safety. Safety played a large role in the building of the Empire State Building. Two main safety concerns were getting passengers safely on and off dirigibles and the substances they were filled with. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable,"" (paragraph @NUM1). This flammability posed a significant risk to the building and the city. The next obstacle the builders faced was nature. The wind speeds would shift due to violent air currents, causing the dirigibles to swivel around. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" (paragraph @NUM2). This made docking incredibly difficult and dangerous. Due to nature and safety issues, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles allowing dirigibles to dock there, ultimately preventing the successful use of the mooring mast."
801	15634	6	3	"When attempting to allow dirigibles to dock atop the Empire State Building, the builders were faced with obstacles. One obstacle they faced was the strong wind current. As said in paragraph @NUM1, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would cause the back of the ship to swivel around the mast, making docking incredibly dangerous and difficult. Another obstacle was the added stress that would be put on the foundation of the building. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate..."" the immense weight and pull of a massive airship, which was a costly and complex engineering challenge, as stated in paragraph @NUM2. A third obstacle the builders faced in this matter was the dangers of fire, as well as the chances of endangering those down below, which is discussed in paragraph @NUM3, because any accident involving the dirigible could have catastrophic consequences for the city below. One last obstacle faced by the builders was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM4), which presented a legal hurdle that would need to be overcome to even attempt the docking procedure. Those are just some of the many major obstacles faced by builders attempting to dock dirigibles on the top of the then tallest building in the world."
802	15635	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. However, this task was not so easy. The builders of the Empire State Building could not just drop a mooring mast on its flat roof because they had to consider how the size of the dirigibles were affected. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). Also, it would be difficult to transmit the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. ""Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"" (paragraph @NUM1). This highlights the significant challenges and costs associated with adapting the building for dirigible docking, showcasing the complexities beyond a simple rooftop addition."
803	15636	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there is that they had to make the Empire State Building taller. The builders added a mooring mast to the top of the building to allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to allow the passengers on or off the dirigible. The dirigibles were to be docked via an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied to the mast. The architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless tower that would be illuminated from the inside. The roof had to be completed before the framing for the mooring mast could take place. Everything went as planned as the builders wanted it to, demonstrating innovative engineering to accommodate this ambitious vision.
804	15637	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One challenge was the existence of a law preventing airships from flying too low over urban areas. Furthermore, they couldn't anchor down the back of the blimp, and the shifting winds at that altitude made passenger transfer unsafe. The building's structure also required modification to maintain stability with a dirigible attached. Finally, the differences in gases used to keep the blimps afloat posed a significant risk; many dirigibles from outside of the United States used highly flammable hydrogen rather than helium. These are some of the obstacles builders of the Empire State Building faced to allow dirigibles to dock there.
805	15638	6	3	They faced challenges such as how to get the dirigibles to anchor on the building; there was really no safe way to do it. They also stated the gas that keeps it floating is highly flammable, making it one big safety concern. In reality, they ended up realizing it's too dangerous for them to do because of these issues. If they took the chance and something went wrong, innocent people could die, ultimately making the idea unfeasible due to the unacceptable level of risk.
806	15639	6	3	The dirigibles had @NUM1 obstacles to face. They had possibilities of fire, popping, and legal trouble. They feared the dirigible would get on fire for it has hydrogen, that is rather highly flammable. They do not want to relate to the accident that happened in Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937. Also, with the fear of pops, concerns rose. For the wind might blow it off course into another building with a sharp top that could possibly puncture the balloon. They feared this happening in downtown New York where it is highly populated. Another reason, probably the biggest, was that the Empire State Building wanted a law for air crafts flying low over urban areas, so that meant there was no chance they could do what they were planning on doing, ultimately grounding their ambitious plans.
807	15640	6	3	"The biggest obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock was that ""The winds on top of the building were contently shifting due to violent air currents."" Due to the wind currents, dirigibles would not be able to stay still to allow the passengers to disembark. They once tried this. ""In December 1930, the Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" If the winds blew strong enough, it could smash the dirigible into a sharp object. After this attempt there was a building code violation; ""The building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This meant; ""It would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" Meaning any dirigibles could never tie up to the building because of this new law. The biggest obstacle was the winds, and the danger they posed, because it put tremendous stress on the building. Ultimately, the strong and unpredictable winds proved to be an insurmountable challenge, preventing the realization of the dirigible docking plan."
808	15641	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced more problems than expected. One of the first problems they faced was the building's frame could not support an enormous dirigible. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation... over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework"" (@NUM1). The builders were forced to modify the framework which cost a large amount of money, and proved to be a primary obstacle in terms of both finances and structural integrity. Another obstacle the builders faced was the wind caused by nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@NUM1). These winds could potentially make the back of the blimps swivel around the mooring mast, making it incredibly difficult or dangerous to get on or off of the dirigibles, and this unpredictable element posed a significant safety risk. Finally, the builders faced the problem of laws against airships flying too low over urban areas. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (@NUM3). If ships could not even legally approach the building, the builders realized, the obstacles were too great for the mooring mast to work. After realizing all the problems and dangers associated with this idea, from structural issues to unpredictable weather and restrictive laws, they decided the mooring mast would never be successful."
809	15642	6	3	Dirigibles were being hailed as the transportation of the future, considered much better than balloons. In New York City, there was a lack of suitable landing areas for the dirigibles. Now, the Empire State Building seemed like a good idea. Landing on the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or other services. The architects realized they could not just drop a mooring mast on top of the building because the thousand-foot long dirigible would add stress to the building's frame. Engineers soon designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower. The mast had four wings at its corners. The building is now 102 floors. Floors 101 and 102 were for the observation area to double as the boarding area for the dirigible passengers. Workers celebrated framing the entire building after two months. Now people lost their hope, as the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was never to fulfill its purpose, as it was never safe nor practical, and the builders faced so many obstacles; thus, the age of dirigible travel never truly arrived.
810	15643	6	3	Turning the mast on the Empire State Building into a dock for dirigibles had many obstacles. There were obstacles like flamable gas in the dirigibles, dangerous to be near a densely populated area, the wind were constantly shifting due to air currents, and it would be dangling high above pedestrians. These obstacles were very difficult to solve. In the dirigibles, there are filled with hydrogen, and hydrogen is highly flamable if the dirigibles caught on fire, posing a threat to the structure itself and surrounding buildings. It is also dangerous to be above a very densely populated area because if the dirigible ever failed, it would fall on inocent bystanders, causing potentially catastrophic loss of life. It also is dangerous because the winds shift a lot, and it can get popped by other objects or buildings around the dirigible, making docking and undocking extremely hazardous. Thus, why it is difficult to turn the mast into a loading dock for dirigibles. Turning the mast on the Empire State Building into a loading dock for dirigibles is very difficult to do because it is not safe, rendering the concept impractical and ultimately unfeasible.
811	15644	6	3	In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. Safety was a huge issue. Foreign dirigibles often used hydrogen gas to stay aloft, which is highly flammable and presented a significant risk. A fire posed a dangerous threat in such a densely populated area as New York City, potentially causing widespread panic and devastation. Another great obstacle was the turbulent wind at the elevation of the mooring mast, which would have prevented the dirigible from staying in one place. This would make it extremely difficult for passengers to safely board or exit the zeppelin, and for cargo to be efficiently unloaded. One way to solve this problem would be to weigh down the blimp with lead weights, but this was also a dangerous practice, because the weights could fall to the ground and crush those passing by, creating an unacceptable hazard to pedestrians below. Although a mooring mast was in theory, a useful idea, it was neither safe nor practical given the various dangers and logistical nightmares it presented.
812	15645	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof."" A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add significant stress to the building's frame. Therefore, modifications had to be made to the building's framework to strengthen and accommodate the new situation. Another great obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were consulate shifting due to violent air currents."" This would leave the dirigibles swiveling in the air above pedestrians which was neither practical nor safe. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles during the project which unfortunately led to the known fact that the Empire State Building was never going to fulfill its intended purpose."
813	15646	6	3	Some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced on attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were that architects cannot simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building. They would also have to modify and strengthen the steel frame of the Empire State Building, and all this was going to be worth sixty thousand dollars of modifications. These engineers had to try to dope out a practical, workable arrangement, and also the government people in Washington were figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to the mast. This idea of doing this was neither practical nor safe because all these things would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street. This could have never happened either because there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. These were some of the obstacles the builders faced on attempting to allow dirigibles to dock over the Empire State Building, and ultimately they highlighted the impracticality of the entire endeavor.
814	15647	6	3	"The builders and architects faced several different obstacles & dilemnas that intefered with the construction of the Empire State Building. One of them being the funds necessary in order to produce such a large structure. They found themselves constructing and reconstructing the frame of the structure time and time again, all in a feeble attempt to reach the desired perfection. Another obstacle occurred when their entire concept shattered by the fact that not every dirigible intended to land on the mast was fueled by helium. The text reads, ""Most digribles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This displays the severity of the idea, where risks like that just could not be taken, so they abandoned the idea of the mooring mast. Ultimately, the shift away from the dirigible mooring concept highlights the pragmatic decisions that were necessary to ensure the safety and viability of the Empire State Building."
815	15648	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" it shows that it was not easy making the dirigibles a safe docking station. A struggle that was faced during this time was that dirigibles from other countries were made with hydrogen which is highly flammable. This meant that if it was exposed to fire it would instantly catch on fire over the world's most populated city, posing a massive safety risk. Another problem that was faced was the amount of wind at the top of the Empire State building. With all this wind it was hard for pilots of dirigibles to steer; the unpredictable gusts made precision landings incredibly difficult. The wind would toss them around, pilots couldn't take their hands off the gears, constantly fighting for control. These were just two of the many struggles pilots and architects had to face when docking dirigibles at a mast, highlighting the immense challenges in making this ambitious idea a reality."
816	15649	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles. They consulted with experts, including naval officers, taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations at the U.S. Naval Air Station in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The builders also had to meet with the president of a newly formed airship transport company to discuss logistical considerations. Therefore, the construction involved navigating various technical and commercial challenges.
817	15650	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacles when having dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle for example was landing, as New York lacked a suitable landing area for a dirigible. Architects couldn't just drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof; the structure wasn't designed for the immense forces involved. Also, safety was a problem. A German dirigible was destroyed by fire, resulting in significant loss of life. The owners of the Empire State Building realized how the accident could've been worse, especially in a densely populated area like New York. Even nature was an obstacle. Winds were constantly shifting on top of the building, making it difficult to control a large airship. So lead weights were used for the dirigible which wasn't safe, because they were dangling over pedestrians, posing a significant risk. There was a law that airships couldn't fly too low over urban areas, further complicating the docking attempts. Ultimately, these challenges made the dirigible docking plan impractical.
818	15651	6	3	"Based on the article ""The Mooring Mast"" written by @ORGANIZATION2, the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. There are three main reasons why the @CAPS1.S.B. was not used for the purpose it was constructed for. The point of the @CAPS1.S.B. was so that dirigibles, an old word for Blimps, can stop and refuel. The obstacles the @CAPS1.S.B. had to overcome were modifications, nature, and the law. The framework of the @CAPS1.S.B. required costly modifications, amounting to @MONEY1. Secondly, nature posed a challenge, as the winds caused instability in the back of the dirigibles; the impractical solution of adding weights was deemed unsafe. Finally, legal restrictions prevented dirigibles from flying as low as the @CAPS1.S.B. in urban areas, rendering the mooring mast largely unusable and concluding its initial intended purpose."
819	15652	6	3	"Based on the article, ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, including the overall structure of the building being affected by stress from the dirigible, safety issues, and the impact of nature. To start off, the dirigible's weight plus the wind pressure around the building, caused too much stress to the building's frame. The steel frame of the building would have to be strengthened and modified in order for the dirigible to be docked onto it. This modification and strengthening of the building process would call for an investment of over sixty thousand dollars, a significant sum at the time. Next, the safety issue arose after being neglected before the building process began. Most dirigibles that were used outside of the United States contained hydrogen, which is a highly flammable gas, as opposed to using helium. This was a serious problem when a German dirigible named Hindenburg, was destroyed by fire in New Jersey in 1937. @ORGANIZATION2 writes ""the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" (@ORGANIZATION2 @NUM1). This was a major obstacle along with the wind factor. The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting and no lead weights could be placed on the dirigible to stop it from shifting because it was a serious threat to pedestrians below. These powerful gusts made maneuvering the airships extremely difficult and dangerous. In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles that prevented them from becoming a big landing spot for dirigibles."
820	15653	6	3	"While designing a dirigible docked at the top of the Empire State building, the architects and engineers encountered many obstacles. Being such an immense project, these obstacles came naturally. The first obstacle was purely architectural. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building... would add stress to the building's frame."" The architects would have to redesign the building frame in order for the building to last and support the immense weight and forces involved. The two other obstacles should have been clear from the start; the first, being nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Now, the dock not only would be hard to reach, but extremely unsafe for both the airship and its passengers. The last obstacle couldn't have been overcome by the architects or engineers if they tried, not legally anyway. ""... existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" would also restrict the project, and actually stop it altogether, as dirigibles simply could not legally reach the mooring mast. Clearly, some large deciding factors had been overlooked while designing the moor. @ORGANIZATION2's competitive attitude made this so, but ""The Mooring Mast... was never destined to fulfill its purpose,"" effectively rendering the ambitious design a mere novelty."
821	15654	6	3	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION1 building faced obstacles in attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that it would add stress to the building's frame. To accommodate the stress sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications, and strengthening would have to be done. Another obstacle was that dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium and hydrogen is flammable. If something like the German Hindenburg being destroyed by fire was to happen in New York the consequences would be much worse, given the density of the city. Also, the wind would be an obstacle as well, threatening to cause the back of the ship to swivel all around the mooring mast, making docking difficult and dangerous. One of the most overlooked obstacles was that of the law against airships flying too low over urban areas, and it was illegal for the ship to even tie up to the building without violating airspace regulations. Clearly many obstacles stood in the way of attempts to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, ultimately rendering the endeavor impractical.
822	15655	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building face many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was overcoming the extra stress that a docked dirigible would add. In the excerpt The Mooring Mast author Marcia Amidon L¸sted states ""the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation..."" This meant reinforcing the building's structure to withstand immense forces. Another obstacle the builders faced was the violent weather at the top of the building. L¸sted says ""Even if the dirigibles was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and break the mooring mast."" This was a problem because it would make it unsafe for passengers to exit the dirigibles and walk down a gangplank connected to the Empire State building. The wind also made it difficult for a dirigible to navigate to the mooring mast without being blown into other buildings in the area. One of the greatest obstacles was making the mooring mast safe. L¸sted states ""most dirigibles from outside the U.S use hydrogn rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" If a dirigibles were to catch fire over a heavily populated area like New York the casualties would be numerous, making fire prevention a paramount concern. These were some of the many obstacles builders faced when attempting to construct a mooring mast on the Empire State Building."
823	15656	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a lot of trouble and confusion in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. This had never been done before; they didn't know what to expect, except for a mooring mast. At first, Al Smith and his builders thought this was an amazing idea, technology of the future, but things weren't that easy. They faced complications with the Goodyear-Zeppelin Corporation with their research on dirigibles. It was a complicated process because it was high up in the air, and there was a lot of practicing involved to manage the challenges. Next were the alterations made to the building; the building wasn't strong enough to hold the dirigible, so they made $500,000 worth of changes. They finally realized this was an unsafe idea, and it wouldn't be good with the highly flammable helium; they were back to square one. Then the government gave them a law that said no airships flying too low at or over urban areas, which would make it illegal for the dirigibles to tie up to the Empire State Building. And so, the top floors were turned into a soda fountain, marking the end of the dirigible docking dream.
824	15657	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Most of the problems they encountered were when designing the mast itself. They found that they could not just drop a mooring mast on top of the building at a thousand feet. The building was not originally strong enough to handle the immense forces, so they had to strengthen the building with a new steel frame specifically engineered for the added weight and stress. Then the builders also faced significant safety issues related to passenger transfer. At a thousand feet the air currents were extremely violent and unpredictable, making boarding and disembarking perilous. By the end of the construction it was quickly noticed that dirigibles could not safely and reliably land on the Empire State Building, rendering the docking mast impractical.
825	15658	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems that prevented dirigibles from landing there. It was too dangerous to tether dirigibles to the mast of the building for four main reasons. The first was that a dirigible moored to the mast of the building ""would add stress to the building's frame"". This problem was soon solved, however, as the steel frame was changed and it became strong enough to endure the added stress of the intended aerial mooring. Another reason that dirigibles could not be attached to the Empire State building is that dirigibles are highly flammable when they use hydrogen gas. It became apparent that if a dirigible were to catch fire in downtown New York it would be too terrible to risk, given the density of the surrounding area. Dirigibles also couldn't be attached to the mast because the winds on top of the building would cause the back of the ship to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast"" and this would not be safe for passengers or the building itself. Finally, dirigibles could not be moored to the Empire State building because ""the sharp spires of other buildings in the area [could] puncture the dirigible's shell"". The dirigibles could not fly so low without posing a risk to the people and the structural integrity of the airship. Dirigibles could not land at the Empire State Building because there were too many dangers involved in such an endeavor."
826	15659	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced constructing a correct mooring mast for the zeppelins, and concerning the safety of the people in the city were substantial. They also had to account for the weather and how it may have affected the blimps during docking attempts. The builders had to add on more floors to the building and strengthen its base so that the mast could work properly and stay stable, a significant undertaking. Then they ruled out using weights to anchor the blimps in place because of the potential danger to the people on the street below. Also, the chemicals in the blimp's hydrogen were highly flammable and put people around at risk, creating further concerns. Sometimes the winds were too strong for the blimps to get close enough without being punctured or damaged. Ultimately, the builders were faced with impossible obstacles to overcome, making the zeppelin mooring concept impractical despite its initial promise.
827	15660	6	3	Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was a huge challenge for them to face. For example, mother nature itself was one of they're huge challenges they would mostly face. At the top of the Empire State Building, winds were constantly shifting and shifting due to violent air currents. As soon as an dirigible would hook up to the building, workers would have to find a way to keep they're airship from crashing into the building from the rusty winds at the top of the building. Therefore, if a dirigible crashed anywhere on the ground it would burst into an inferno because the inside of a dirigible is filled with hydrogen and helium, so if it did crashed it will involve heat and fire that would be coming from the sparks it prevents as it crashes on the ground. The builders clearly had a difficult task ahead of them, considering the dangerous combination of unpredictable winds and the highly flammable nature of the airships, highlighting the considerable risks involved in such an endeavor.
828	15661	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced included the lack of a suitable landing area, as they planned to ""allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refuel, or service, and to let passengers off and on."" Dirigibles were to be docked by means of a winch, which presented a significant engineering challenge in itself, and that is what they did and faced to dock there, highlighting the innovative spirit required to overcome such unprecedented logistical and structural hurdles."
829	15662	6	3	"In the @ORGANIZATION1 Empire State Building there where many problems that where faced durring the build. The Way that this all STARTED was when the archetect Al Smith wanted to make a building like no other, A building that was taller than the new chrysler building and one that was futureistic. The first problem that they ran into was, what was a building of this size going to be used for? There where many differen't ideas but the one that came to Al Smith's MIND was transportation. This building could be used for a new kind of transportation where people could board a Dirigible ""also known as a blimp"" at the very top of the building. the next problem was if this would be safe to do because they couldn't have a big problem in the middle of New York. The idea went to Washington to be reviewed and ended up not being safe enough. Al Smith didn't care, His building was the tallest, and that's what truly mattered to him in the end."
830	15663	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced included nature itself. Strong winds at dizzying heights and the sheer difficulty of maneuvering materials in the open air presented daily challenges. These natural elements tested the ingenuity and resilience of the construction workers, ultimately shaping the iconic structure we know today.
831	15664	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem they faced was the issue of safety. Most dirigibles were fueled by hydrogen, which was highly flammable. This danger was shown by the Hindenburg disaster in New Jersey, and the owners of the building did not want to face a similar accident in a place as densely populated as New York. Another obstacle that arose was the fact that the violent wind at such an altitude would toss the back of the ship back and forth. This would not only be a technical hassle as it would also make it nearly impossible to get passengers in and out of the dirigible, and make it a frightening experience for anyone inside the ship as well. In addition, the ships could not be weighed down with lead weights as it would be too risky to have them dangling high above pedestrians. A final implication was that if dirigibles moored at the Empire State building, it would violate an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Because of this, docking a ship there would be illegal which obviously was not helpful to the project. Therefore, these considerable hindrances ultimately proved insurmountable. In the end, these obstacles were the key reasons that the endeavor failed.
832	15665	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of these obstacles was that they would have to modify the entire building's steel frame so that it could withstand the extra stress and pressure of having a dirigible moored to its top. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to made to the building's framework."" This was a significant expense and undertaking, requiring considerable engineering adjustments. Another obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced was that dirigibles were highly flammable because they were filled with hydrogen. The owners realized it may be a bad idea when the Hindenburg burst into flames. If that had happened at the Empire State Building it would have had extremely drastic results. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire... The owners of the Empire State The building realized how much worse that accident could of been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" The potential for catastrophic fire was a major deterrent. The biggest obstacle though was nature itself; ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents... The back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This made docking a dangerous and unpredictable proposition, regardless of the structural and safety modifications. These were just three of the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in trying to allow dirigibles to dock there, ultimately proving the impracticality of the endeavor."
833	15666	6	3	During construction of the mooring mast atop the Empire State Building, the builders faced many challenges. If they had just put a spire on top of the building, the weight of a dirigible could destroy it. The construction team needed to go back and reinforce the entire framework of the building. Other obstacles in their way included low-flying aircraft laws, difficult weather conditions, and safety concerns should a dirigible crash over New York. For all these reasons, the mooring mast was doomed from the start.
834	15667	6	3	"In the passage ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, she talked about the obstacles faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. The three main obstacles were safety, mother nature, and existing laws. One of the greatest obstacles was safety. L¸sted states, ""... Never fulfilled its purpose... The greatest reason was one safety: Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Because hydrogen is highly flammable there would be no way that would be safe. The building could catch fire and be a danger for all. Moreover, a spark could ignite the hydrogen, leading to a catastrophic explosion. Secondly, nature itself would have an effect on the dirigibles. L¸sted states, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The violent air currents couldn't allow dirigibles to be on the Empire State Building because you can't have dirigibles with violent air currents. It isn't safe, and the unpredictable winds made docking incredibly difficult, if not impossible. Lastly, laws were an obstacle the builders had to face: L¸sted's knowledge is, ""The other practical lesson why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" The law was a huge obstacle for the builders building the dirigibles, since approaching the Empire State Building required violating this airspace restriction. Because you can't build something with it being against the law. Because of safety concerns, the uncooperative forces of mother nature, and restrictive laws, that's what stopped the builders from realizing their vision of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building."
835	15668	6	3	The challenges the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were the high winds and the building struggled to stay up. The builders had difficulty getting the building to how they want it. They kept adding to the building and making it taller. The dirigibles needed it to be bigger so they could see it. The problem was that it kept on breaking or something would go wrong with the mooring mast. They kept working on the building to try and get it right but continued to fail. They had to make their plans realistic and that was there major problem. Ultimately, the impracticality of docking airships at such a height due to weather conditions and safety concerns led to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan.
836	15669	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced on letting things dock there was the law against air ships, safety and nature. There was a law that said that air craft's weren't allowed to fly that low, thus ""this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" Also it was unsafe due to the hydrogen in the dirigibles, since ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Nature was a factor because of the high winds. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These shifting winds posed a significant challenge to safely mooring a large airship. Due to the legal, safety, and environmental obstacles that the engineers never fully anticipated, the Empire State Building never became a practical dirigible landing."
837	15670	6	3	"Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the safety of New York people. They could have used hydrogen and the dirigible could have caught on fire and landed somewhere bad. As said in paragraph @NUM1, ""The greatest obstacle to the succesful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Winds on top of the building were constantly shifting because of violent air currents. Even if they were tethered to the mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mast. Furthermore, there is a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, making the docking procedure even more complicated. Thus, considering the dangers and impracticalities, the idea of using the mooring mast had quietly disappeared."
838	15671	6	3	"The builders faced many obstacles while trying to add a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building. As stated in paragraph fourteen, nature was the biggest obstacle the builders faced. The ""violent air currents"" would cause dirigibles to move around the mooring mast, even if it was tethered. Another obstacle faced, was that the architects couldn't just add a mooring mast to the top of the building; over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications were made to the building's framework, reinforcing it to withstand the additional stress. Lastly, as stated in paragraph thirteen, most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION1 used hydrogen rather than helium, even though it was flammable. When the German dirigible, Hindenburg, went up in flames, the owners of the building realized the dangers of this, making the mooring mast idea significantly less appealing and ultimately impractical."
839	15672	6	3	The builders faced many obstacles. They could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat surface; it took a lot of stress and hard work. The dirigible, held by a single cable tether and about a thousand feet long, presented unique challenges. That made the builders very stressed and made them think clearly and carefully about the wind pressure and also the dirigible's load, given the height and potential sway.
840	15673	6	3	There were a few problems with the dirigibles docking on the Empire State Building. One problem would be the foundation, potentially compromising its structural integrity. If dirigibles were to land on the building it would cause tension on the building's foundation, squishing it down. The architects would need to have made adjustments to the foundation in order for a dirigible to land safely and securely. Another problem was the way the ship would be docked; the envisioned mooring process posed considerable risk. When the ship would be docked, it would be a hazard because it would sway back and forth around the mast, especially in strong winds. This instability could result in either causing damage to the building itself or injury to people of New York. Thus, the concept, while ambitious, presented too many safety and structural challenges to be viable.
841	15674	6	3	"There were many obstacles faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building. One of these obstacles was the wind currents atop the building. They were uncontrollable, forceful, and unexpected. In @CAPS1 @NUM1 it explains how a U.S. Navy dirigible attempted to dock but could not due to the winds, ""U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds"" (L¸sted) @CAPS2 the winds were an issue. Another problem was a law against airships that flew too low to the ground in urban areas. Not only was the idea dangerous, but it was also illegal. On May 6, 1937, a German dirigible called Hindenburg exploded in Lakehurst, New Jersey. This was due to the flammable hydrogen that was used to lift the dirigible. Since all dirigibles at this time obtained hydrogen another threat was introduced. This was the chance of it exploding while trying to dock on the Empire State Building. If it exploded while above numerous citizens, many lives would be in @CAPS3. Considering the high winds, legal restrictions, and the potential for catastrophic explosions, the mooring mast idea was, in the end, non-sense."
842	15675	6	3	Dirigibles, blimps, were being hailed as the transportation of the future in the 1920s. They had a top speed of eighty miles per hour, and they could cruise at seventy miles per hour for thousands of miles without needing refueling. One obstacle the builders faced was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith spotted the opportunity for his Empire State building. He was to add a mooring mast to the top of the building, thus allowing dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service. Also, it would let people off and on. The problem with this was that the builders couldn't just set the mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof; if a thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the structure, held by a single cable tether, it would add stress to the building's frame, requiring significant structural reinforcement to handle the immense forces involved. Ultimately, this impracticality contributed to the abandonment of the mooring mast concept.
843	15676	6	3	In @DATE1, the Empire State Building was constructed and would be used to house a new form of travel. The mooring mast, constructed at the top of the building, would be used to dock one-thousand foot dirigibles; the future of travel. In theory, the blimp would be docked at the mast, using an electric winch, but in reality, there was no safe way of doing so at such a high altitude. Another challenge faced was the highly flammable gas, hydrogen, which was used for buoyancy. One lit match could send the steel frame plummeting to the earth below. The soft fabric which covered the steel frame could easily be punctured, which was unsuitable for an urban area. The men constructing the blimp either looked over, or forgot the elements of nature which restricted this project. At the peak of the building, winds reached high velocities, and shifted directions rapidly which would have wrapped the dirigible around the mast. The greatest obstacle was the law, restricting airships from flying too low over New York's growing urban civilization. In the Empire State Building's history, one blimp has attempted to simulate a dock, and another has performed a newspaper stunt. Any man in his right mind would see that this project was doomed before it had begun. The impracticality of docking airships at such a height, combined with safety concerns and legal restrictions, ultimately made the mooring mast a failed experiment, highlighting the challenges of blending futuristic visions with real-world limitations.
844	15677	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. They consulted with experts, taking tours of equipment and mooring operations in New Jersey. The architects couldn't just drop the mooring mast on top of the building, if it did it would add stress to the building's frame. The stress of the load would have been transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. The steel frame would have to be modified and strengthened. The greatest obstacle was nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swing around and around the mooring mast. You could weigh it down but that would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, which was neither practical nor safe. There was also a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, and when they tried delivering newspapers they noticed it wasn't going to work. Ultimately, the combination of structural challenges, unpredictable weather, safety concerns, and legal restrictions made the dirigible docking plan unfeasible, leading to its abandonment.
845	15678	6	3	The builders had to face a lot. They had to rebuild the whole top again so the dirigibles could dock there. Architects couldn't just drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building. A dirigible on top of a building held by a single cable tether would add a lot of stress to the building's frame. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be upgraded and strengthened to withstand these forces. Also, all of these modifications would cost over sixty thousand dollars to make the building's framework better, demonstrating the significant engineering and financial challenges involved in accommodating airship docking.
846	15679	6	3	To have a building built over @NUM1 ft. tall and expect dirigibles/blimps to be able to dock there is dangerous and has many obstacles around it. First, the weather is not always nice; strong winds would make docking a blimp incredibly difficult. If you have a windy day, the blimp is going to sway back and forth over thousands of pedestrians in New York. Putting lead blocks in the back to stabilize the blimp would be very dangerous; you have lead in the back swaying with thousands of people underneath you. Secondly, most blimps outside of the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is very flammable and could destroy a whole building if the fire spread. Finally, blimps could not moor at the Empire State building if it is against the law for an airship to hover too low to urban areas. These significant safety and regulatory concerns highlight why blimps could not moor at the Empire State building.
847	15680	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A 835 foot dirigible would add stress to the building's frame. Most dirigibles out of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable. The accident of the Hindenburg also raised alarm. The Hindenburg set fire on Lakehurst in New Jersey. This showed the builders how much worse the accident could have been if it had happened over a densely populated area, such as New York. Another factor was the wind currents. They were constantly unpredictable. This would cause the back of the dirigible to sway and move about. There was also a preexisting law stating that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. These are some of the reasons and obstacles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, ultimately making the ambitious plan impractical.
848	15681	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle is described in paragraph @NUM1, ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would exert considerable torque and stress to the building's frame."" This means that they would need to strengthen the whole building considerably to withstand the forces. If they didn't, the structural integrity of the building would be compromised. The next obstacle is described in paragraph @NUM2, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" This means that the wind is so strong at that height, it would make safe landings very difficult. Also, the strong winds could potentially cause the dirigible to break free. The LEGAL obstacle is described in paragraph @NUM3, ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This means they could be a potential target in a populated area. Another concern was the potential for catastrophic failure and the resulting loss of life. These obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were ultimately insurmountable, and the project was cancelled, proving the impracticality of the ambitious vision."
849	15682	6	3	"There are many obstacles that the builders faced in order to allow dirigibles to dock atop the Empire State Building. One obstacle was safety. Foreign countries used highly flammable gases to fill their dirigibles with. According to the passage ""when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire state building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Another obstacle was weather. The winds on top of the building were always shifting because of the violent air currents. For example, a U.S. Navy dirigible, Los Angeles couldn't tie up to the mast because of the wind, which might have resulted in a puncture in the shell of the dirigible. One more obstacle was the law banning airships from flying too low over urban areas. According to the passage ""This law would make it illegal to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"". These challenges ultimately proved insurmountable. Because of the many obstacles that the builders faced, the Empire State building was unable to fulfill its original purpose, but is still considered a worldwide landmark today."
850	15683	6	3	In the article 'The Mooring Mast' by @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1 describes several problems the builders of the Empire State Building faced in trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, most blimps outside of the United States used hydrogen, rather than helium. Since hydrogen is highly flammable, and since downtown New York is so populated, if anything were to go wrong it could impact the people of New York, resulting in injuries as well as deaths. Another reason is an existing law against flying airships too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a ship to even approach the area. Overall, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles that could have been noticed before building, ultimately rendering the mooring mast impractical despite its initial promise.
851	15684	6	3	@CAPS1 taller @CAPS2 hoisting When building the Empire State Building, the workers faced a few problems. One was how to make it taller, because the architect building the Chrysler Building had raised the total height, making it the largest building in the world. Al Smith, former governor of New York, said they were going to beat it by putting a mooring mast for the dirigibles. Another obstacle was hoisting the mast to the top of the frame. It could not be dropped on, so sixty thousand dollars worth of maintenance had to be done to the frame to ensure its stability during the lifting process. A third problem they had was tying up the dirigibles, violent winds could turn the Blimp around, possibly puncturing it. After the Hindenburg atrocity, the people in charge would not let blimps dock at the Building, for fear of endangering the Public. Thus, the mast was never used.
852	15685	6	3	"People involved in the design and construction of the Empire State Building were faced with a few major obstacles in attempting to transform the idea of docking dirigibles to reality. One of the biggest complications was that if a massive dirigible was tied to the building by a ""cable tether"" then stress would be put on the building's frame. The builders and architects had to find a way to allow the stress to travel down the foundation of the building. They spent over @MONEY1 modifying the framework. In paragraph @NUM2 we read that the architects and builders worked through the obstacle of storage by putting the winches and control machinery in the base of the shaft of the ""conical roof"". This strategic placement addressed the practical challenges of managing the complex equipment required for mooring airships and ensured the feasibility of the ambitious docking plan."
853	15686	6	3	Although the builders dream of using the Empire State Building as a dock for dirigibles was a brilliant one, the builders came across many problems. One problem was the law against flying too low over urban areas like New York City. Also, nature played a huge part in why their plan didn't work; the violent wind currents throughout the city affected the plan. Most dirigibles landed in open fields where their back end could be weighted down, a practice essential for safe mooring. This would be impossible docked to the building causing the dirigible to sway around possibly hitting other buildings. The builders didn't take into consideration how densely populated New York City is. If anything ever happened to a docked dirigible like the Hindenburg many people would be affected, leading to a potentially catastrophic situation. This is why the idea always stayed a dream.
854	15687	6	3	The obstical's the builder's took on Were difficult, and time consuming. In Way's Such as the onley benefit's the Empire State building relly passed Was being the tallest building in the world. They also attempted to create a dirigible's docking base for future transportation but filed to do so during certain law's and technicall difficulties. Such obsticles such as adding extra body work to the building's structure was not even neccarasary.Those are the obsticle's the builder's faced and as well as limited time and resources.
855	15688	6	3	"Based on the excerpt the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that a ""thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by single cable tether would add stress to the buildings frame."" This is a very important obstacle because if the frame becomes too stressed by the excess weight of the dirigible the building might collapse. Another obstacle is wind. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". This is also a major obstacle because the dirigibles were very light, lighter than air, so the violent winds would swing it around; that high in the air is not a safe thing, especially considering that downtown is below where there are thousands of people. And a third obstacle was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This made it illegal to fly that low in order to tie the blimp up to the building, effectively making the docking idea unfeasible due to legal restrictions. These significant structural, meteorological, and legal challenges ultimately made the dirigible docking plan impossible to implement."
856	15689	6	3	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, builders of the Empire State Building were faced with obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The author writes, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mas was nature itself."" (L¸sted, paragraph @NUM1) It was reported that the winds on top of the building were constantly changing because of violent air currents. A dirigible on the building would not be able to land properly or be weighted down with lead weights like those in open landing fields. It would not be practical to dangle weight over the heads of hundreds of people walking in the streets below. In addition to nature itself, safety was another great obstacle that the builders were faced with. It is written that, ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (L¸sted, paragraph @NUM2). This flammability presented a significant danger, as even a small spark could ignite the hydrogen. Since hydrogen is highly flammable, an accident could be extreme in a densely populated area like downtown New York where the Empire State Building was located. An accident had already occurred with a German dirigible by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. When all is said and done, nature and safety were two obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."
857	15690	6	3	What the builders were faced with while trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, one of them was nature and its unpredictable forces. The winds at the top of the building were always shifting because of violent air currents. Even if they were able to tie the front of the dirigibles to the building, the cable holding it would cause pressure on the building's structure. The only way you could prevent the building from experiencing this pressure was to modify the building to make it stronger, which would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Even if they were able to overcome all these obstacles, there was also a law against airships flying too low over the city. So, considering the winds, the structural concerns, and the legal restrictions, docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building was ultimately an impossibility.
858	15691	6	3	A dirigible is not like a plane or a hot air balloon; it is filled with flammable gases like hydrogen. To try to dock something that big on top of the world's tallest building would be extremely dangerous to the urban town below, risking potential explosions and fires, and extremely dangerous for the workers involved in the docking procedure. Therefore, the inherent risks associated with flammable gas and high altitudes make the concept impractical and unsafe.
859	15692	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" author Marcia Amidon L¸sted speaks of the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, the frame of the Building had not been built to withstand a thousand foot long blimp docking to it. Therefore, changes would have to be made to make the building stronger. As the excerpt says, ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"". This included reinforcing the upper structure to handle the immense weight and stress. Also, having dirigibles dock to the building would be unsafe for many reasons. For example, dirigibles were often filled with hydrogen rather than helium, and as the excerpt points out ""hydrogen is highly flammable"" thus, the owners of the building realized that it could cause tragedy if a blimp were to crash while flying above New York's busy streets. A single spark could ignite the hydrogen, resulting in a catastrophic explosion. Also, strong winds at the top of the building made it difficult and dangerous for blimps to dock at the mooring mast, because they would cause the back of the ship to constantly move. These unpredictable gusts made maneuvering a large airship near the building a perilous task. Finally, there were laws preventing aircrafts to fly so low over the city. These altitude restrictions further complicated the feasibility of the mooring mast project. There were many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock to the building."
860	15693	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many different obstacles in trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. The main challenge was to be able to design the mast without having to reconstruct a big part of the building. Also a big aspect of what they had to face was to be able to make it safe. These big dirigibles can be very flammable and having something that major in a very populated city like New York would be very risky and unsafe, which they had to account for. The last problem they faced was nature, specifically the high winds. Of course you cannot change nature so this was a problem that was there since the beginning, but was probably overlooked or never even thought about. So this really never would have been able to successfully work without any problems, making the entire endeavor ultimately impractical.
861	15694	6	3	The problems that the Empire State Building faced were a lot of things; for one example, it was never thought out clearly because they didn't know about the law that aircrafts could not come above any suburb areas, and they really saw what could have happened when the Hindenburg burned to the ground. Another great obstacle they faced was nature, because the winds on top of the building were always shifting because of violent air currents, and this would cause the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast. One last obstacle that was faced was the structure of the dirigible, because if it kept on landing on top of the building, it would keep on destroying the building's structure. These factors ultimately contributed to the abandonment of the dirigible mooring plan.
862	15695	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigible to dock there. The dirigibles also called blimps were very big, this was a problem because they were too large and could not get to the building and ""most dirigible outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (par. @NUM1) This is bad because an accident could occur and the blimp could explode right over the city and hurt thousands of people. The winds above the building were sometimes violent and it was hard for dirigibles to reach it, ""Even if the dirigible tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" (par. @NUM2) This made the docking process incredibly difficult and unpredictable. It was difficult attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. The original purpose for which the top of the building was created ultimately could not be used because it was too dangerous."
863	15696	6	3	"In the making of the Empire Building the builders faced some problems. All of these problems or negative for what they actually wanted to do. Some of these problems were because of what the balloon was made of. Most balloons used hydrogen instead of helium, and the balloons were very large. In the excerpt they say ""hydrogen is highly flammable"" which could cause many deaths. Also another was strong winds that could carry the balloon and be hard to handle; this could lead to the balloon colliding with buildings. Last situation would be that there is a law about low-flying vehicles and the balloon flys low, which is also an issue. In conclusion the problems they had could not be fixed, so the plan was ruined."
864	15697	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the law. There was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (∂ @NUM1). Although at first the builders looked past this, there were many other non-legal obstacles that they faced. There was also a safety issue with docking dirigibles, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (∂ @NUM2), which posed a significant risk to the building and the city below. One last obstacle the builders faced was the wind. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (∂ @NUM3), making it difficult for airships to maintain a stable position for docking. With all of these obstacles it would not only be improbable, but close to impossible to dock dirigibles on the mast of the Empire State Building."
865	15698	6	3	When Al Smith wanted to make a dock on the Empire State Building he wasnt really thinking straight. That was a horrible idea. Passengers would risk their lifes going on and off the dirigibles. He probably wasnt thinking about safety things and just was going for looks. The obstacles he would encounter words death from idiots that would go up there, weather, and costs. The weather was a huge factor because if it were to be windy it could through the dirigibles to go off course and crash. The costs to make this landing pad would be crazy too because they would have to buy all the floats and make a landing station. Authorities werent in a smart guy for letting dirigibles for landing. Ultimately, the impracticality and danger of Smith's vision highlight the importance of prioritizing safety and practicality over mere aesthetics.
866	15699	6	3	"The biggest and most obvious obstacles of attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building were the factors of safety, nature and the city's law concerning low-flying airships. According to the article The Mooring Mast by @PERSON1 the greatest safety risk was that most blimps made/operated outside the U.S ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (paragraph @NUM1) @CAPS1 a hydrogen filled dirigible to float above densely populated @ORGANIZATION2 would have been too dangerous of a risk. In 1937 a hydrogen blimp did catch fire, and the outcome was disastrous; owners of the Empire State knew another accident like that above New York would have been much worse. In higher altitudes winds increase, and the winds atop the Empire State would cause the blimp's tail end to spend about. Normally the tail end would be weighted down, but weights hanging above the city isn't safe either. During one of the two failed attempts at docking of the building the winds were too fierce for the dirigible to even get close to the building. The capitan of the blimp feared ""... that the wind would blow with the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area..."" (paragraph @NUM2) and that could put a hole in the blimp. Lastly, a law in New York City states that airships can't fly below a specific altitude, thus making the docking of a dirigible on top of the Empire State illegal. Many apparent obstacles were over looked in the planning of the Empire State Building's blimp dock, ultimately rendering the ambitious plan impractical and unsafe."
867	15700	6	3	"While constructing the mast to dock dirigibles to the Empire State Building, there were many obstacles that led to the end of this project. An inevitable obstacle was that most dirigibles were filled with extremely flammable hydrogen, that could be detrimental to the condensed New York City streets as well as the Empire State Building, if exploded. Also, wind on top of the building was out of there control, and with the violent wind currents, docking would be highly dangerous. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Although it would be possible to strap lead weights to the back end of the blimp to help with stability, it would be unpractical and highly dangerous to the public. Dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building even if the docking station was completed because of an existing law that forbids airships flying too low over urban areas. ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear."" Considering the multitude of challenges, from volatile gases to unpredictable weather and legal restrictions, the obstacles that stood before the Empire State Building's mast were too great to optimistically believe the project could be finished. It was postponed and ultimately became obsolete with the invention of airplanes."
868	15701	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there included the ever-shifting winds atop the building due to violent air currents. Furthermore, the dirigibles used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, meaning a potential explosion would cause significant damage in New York City. Also, a law restricted airships from flying too low over urban areas. The building also needed modifications and reinforcement to handle the weight and stress imposed by mooring a dirigible. These factors ultimately contributed to the abandonment of the ambitious dirigible docking plan.
869	15702	6	3	"@ORGANIZATION1 on the excerpt from The Mooring mast by Marcia Amidon L√ºsted there were many obsticles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obsticle the builders faced was safety. Paragraph @NUM1 states, most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable ""The owners of the Empire State Building realized how horrible an accident could be if it takes place in a highly populated area. The greatest obsticle the builders faced was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent wind currents"" paragraph @NUM2 states. They could have weighted it down with lead weights, but using these where they would be hanging above pedestrians was not safe. The last obsticle the builder faced was the law was against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for any ship to dock at the @ORGANIZATION1 on the excerpt from The Mooring Mast, there were many obsticles builders faced to allow dirigibles to dock there. Ultimately, these safety, environmental, and legal hurdles proved insurmountable, leading to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan."
870	15703	6	3	While attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building, the architects faced many obstacles. Usually, when given an obstacle, you either succeed it or fail it. In this case, these men didn't overcome the obstacle. In the reading, it mentioned that dirigibles from outside the U. S. contained hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable and it could cause a lot of damage, not only to the building itself, but the area of downtown New York as well. Winds at the top of the building were shifting due to air currents, which could cause the dirigibles to circle the mast when even tied down, creating a dangerous situation. The architects also had to think about the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, posing legal and logistical problems. The builders didn't realize how complicated the process of even tying down a dirigible would be because of the high winds, making the docking procedure extremely hazardous. Even the process of dropping off newspapers was difficult, and took up too much time, rendering the whole concept impractical. Who would want enormous steel framed balloons dangling over them anyways, considering the potential risks? Ultimately, the combination of safety concerns, logistical nightmares, and legal restrictions made the dirigible docking plan an unworkable proposition.
871	15704	6	3	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there is that it was strictly hard for architects to drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire Building; held by a single cable tether, it would add stress to the building's frame. Many dilemmas and complications the builders faced included wind velocity at that altitude and the potential danger to passengers transferring from airship to building. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework in an attempt to make this ambitious plan a reality, highlighting the significant structural challenges involved.
872	15705	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first initial issue that they faced was the stress the blimp would put on the building As the article states here, ""the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation...the building would have to be modified and strengthened to accomodate the situation."", the stress prompted the need for further improvements on the building itself; which obviously costs time and money. Another problem they faced was the impracticality of the dirigibles themselves. The dirigibles require hydrogen, which is highly flammable. As a result of the Hindenburg disaster, ""the owners of the empire state building realized how much worse that accident would have been over a densely populated area such as downtown New York City"" Another great issue that presented itself was the inconsistent violent air currents, which made safe docking for the blimps difficult. This problem could be combated with lead weights, but they ""were neither practical nor safe."" And lastly, there was already ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law prevented the blimps from being able to fly as low as the building, let alone land there. These considerable challenges ultimately proved insurmountable. In conclusion, the builders of the mooring mast at the E.S.B. faced many obstacles in its construction which questioned its safety and prevented it from being practical."
873	15706	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Starting with putting a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State building, the architects couldn't just place it there. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof"" (paragraph @NUM1). They had to modify the steel frame of the building. They had to do this all the way from the building's foundation, ""which was nearly eleven hundred feet below"" (paragraph @NUM1), to properly support the structure. This extensive modification would cost more than sixty thousand dollars. Once the mooring mast was built, the builders still encountered more problems. Dirigibles coming in from outside the United States ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (paragraph @NUM3). So the flammable dirigibles were too dangerous to fly over such a populated place as New York City. Also the winds at the top of the Empire State Building were too strong. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (paragraph @NUM4), making docking nearly impossible and potentially damaging to both the airship and the building. In the end, the problems the builders faced were too many, and unfixable, so the docking of dirigibles in the Empire State Building was no more than a failed, albeit ambitious, concept."
874	15707	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle was that it was very dangerous to have a hydrogen (highly flammable) filled dirigible dock over one of the most densely populated areas at the time. They could not let the accident that had happened in Lakehurst, New Jersey happen in New York: ""..., The owners of the Empire State building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" The greatest obstacle was due to natural causes: ""The winds on top of the building were consular shifting due to violent air currents."" This made it impossible for crews to effectively guide and secure the massive airships. The dirigible would not be able to stay steady for docking or unloading. Other ideas to solve this problem like weights were, ""neither practical or safe."" The final obstacle was the law. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". As shown, It was simply impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building because of natural causes, danger, and the law itself."
875	15708	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem was the structure of the building; after the mast was designed, they needed a building that could withstand the stress of the mast. Rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower, and they were able to overcome that obstacle. Another obstacle was safety. Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. What obstacles did that bring? Well, hydrogen is highly flammable. When a German dirigible was destroyed by a fire in New Jersey, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area. That safety obstacle brought upon another obstacle of practicality. Dirigibles customarily landed in open fields. The greatest obstacle to successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building made it unsafe; the only solution would be tethering the dirigible and weighing down the back with lead weights, but using these at the building, dangling high over pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe. Thus, the architects faced many obstacles that ultimately made the dirigible mooring concept untenable.
876	15709	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Building. One of the greatest reasons was saftey, most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, the latter being non-flammable. Hydrogen is also highly flammable. Another obstacle that arose was nature, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. If the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would sway violently with the wind. Other dirigibles moored in open fields added lead wights on the back of them so they could not move, offering stability. But there is no where for those weights to be attached to at the top of the Empire State Building. A practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building. Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempt to moor a dirigible, ultimately rendering the ambitious mooring mast concept impractical and unsafe.
877	15710	6	3	The builder of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of these problems, (that was noticed after building of the Mooring Mast), was how difficult it would be to keep a blimp steady and attached to something without pulling the building over on itself, especially given the massive size of these airships. Another issue was safety, and one thing that was unsafe about it was that most dirigibles from other countries use hydrogen instead of helium, which is very flammable and posed a significant risk of explosion in the heart of New York City. One more reason was because of high air currents that would blow the back part of the ship around uncontrollably, making docking maneuvers extremely hazardous. These significant challenges ultimately led to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan.
878	15711	6	3	"In the excerpt 'The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First of all, if a thousand-foot dirigible held by a single cable tether was moored at the top of the building, it would add stress to the frame. The workers had to transmit the stress ""All the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" They had to modify & strengthen the frame, which would cost over sixty thousand dollars. They also had to design an ornamental mast with four wings to house the mooring arm. What the builders did not realize was that their mooring mast not only had problems the frame work, but the dirigible would swivel around without being able to use lead weights to hold it down. There was nothing they could do to prevent this, flammability, or existing laws, which ultimately rendered the mooring mast project impractical."
879	15712	6	3	There were three main reasons as to why the Empire State Building would not serve well as a mooring mast for the dirigibles. For one, it was unsafe due to the flammable nature of the gas used. Most of dirigibles were filled with highly flammable hydrogen and the fear of a Hindenburg repeat was to great, especially over a highly populated city like New York. Two, violent air currents were present in and around New York City due to the city's geography. Docking a dirigible would be too difficult and if it were docked, the wind would make it unsafe and could potentially damage the airship. Lastly, a law was passed that made it illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas, primarily due to safety concerns. This made it impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building without violating the law. These three obstacles were all contributing factors as to why the Empire State Building could not serve as a dirigible mooring mast, thus abandoning the initial plan.
880	15713	6	3	"Marcia Amidon L¸sted, in her excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", describes the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle they would have to faced was realized during the designing of the mast that would be put on top of the building for docking. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" (paragraph 1) They found that a dirigible docked on top of the building would add too much stress to the building's frame. Therefore, their first obstacle was to make modifications that would strengthen the building's framework. However, as L¸sted points out in paragraph 2, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Due to rough air currents at the top of the building, the winds would constantly be shifting making even a dirigible tethered to the mast sway around. Another issue was the question of how to weight the dirigables down. In open landing fields, they would weight dirigibles down with lead weights. Using extremely heavy weights while being above hundreds of people on the streets would not be acceptable. In conclusion, as one can see, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in trying to allow dirigibles to dock there."
881	15714	6	3	"When builders attempted building a structure to allow dirigibles, or blimps, to dock on the Empire State Building in New York, they did not realize how many problems they would encounter. Upon designing the mast on top of the building, designers realized that if a dirigible was docked on to the building, it would add stress to the frame, and therefore, would have to modify the Empire State building's structure. To do this, sixty thousand dollars was needed, as well as more hours of labor. Another obstacle encountered was the fact that nature got in the way, and ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (line @NUM1). It would be difficult to dock it to the building, because the dirigible would be constantly swaying due to wind, and passengers could not get on the blimp safely. Furthermore, blimps usually were moored in open fields, with the aid of lead weights to help weigh them down. If lead weights were introduced in New York City, where it was very populated, they could potentially fall while dangling in the air, endangering pedestrians. In conclusion, builders faced many obstacles while trying to achieve docking capability for dirigibles on the Empire State Building, making the prospect ultimately unfeasible."
882	15715	6	3	"There were many obstacles that the architects of the Empire State Building faced, one of them was redesigning some parts of the Empire State Building. The architects' job was to create the mast for docking new airships called dirigibles or blimps. This plan came with great difficulty; they couldn't simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. They came to figure out that a ""thousand-foot dirigible moored, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"" (paragraph 1). This stress would have to be transmitted to the building's foundation. The architects had to modify and strengthen the steel frame in order to accommodate the situation of the stress on the building frame. Also creating the rocket shaped mast the architects had to work on many different parts. The winches and control machinery for the dirigible mooring had to be done precisely in order for everything to work. These were the obstacles the architects faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
883	15716	6	3	The main problem they had with the docking of the dirigibles was it would have to be really safe. To hold the aircraft down they would have to use lead weights; if weights fell from the top of the building in such a dense, populated area it would be very dangerous. Also when the owners of the Empire State got notice of the Hindenburg blowing up they felt uneasy. Even if the aircraft was floating moored to the top of the building, the wind would whip it around, making it even more unsafe. The idea was good but not probable to be safe; the risks associated with passenger transfer and the structural integrity of the mooring system were simply too great to ignore.
884	15717	6	3	When building the Empire State Building, there were obstacles faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building frame. So the architects had to modify it and strengthen the building, spending over sixty thousand dollars on the new modification. The building would turn from 86 floors to 102. From there dirigible passengers would board. In conclusion, when building the Empire State Building, there were obstacles faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.
885	15718	6	3	There were many issues that made it impossible to use the Mast of the Empire State Building as a dock for dirigibles. One was that many foreign dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, a very flammable gas. If one caught fire like the Hindenburg, it would cause many tragedies because it would be above people's homes. For the same reason, there was a law against dirigibles flying too low over cities. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. Besides the safety risks for people below, there was the wind, causing a problem that the blimp could not even dock correctly. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around. One of the attempts proved that it would be tricky to land. The Los Angeles attempted to reach the building, but retired the thought because of the wind. The captain feared he could fly into one of the spires of a tall building and the dirigible could be punctured; he could not even take his hands off the control lever. Ultimately, the combination of flammable gases, restrictive laws, and unpredictable winds made the Empire State Building's dirigible dock an unfeasible concept.
886	15719	6	3	In the article The Mooring Mast by @PERSON1 @CAPS1, she describes the difficulties of designing the Mast for Dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State building. Al Smith, the mayor of New York City at the time of construction of the Empire State building, came up with the idea to add a mooring mast to the top of the building. He wanted to make New York City a technologically advanced city. After the mast was proposed, designers discovered problems with the mast being installed. They discovered that they would have to modify the steel frame because if a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building would transmit stress all the way down the frame to the foundation due to the load and wind pressure. The wind speeds on the top of the building would blow the dirigible around in the wind; this is very unsafe being close to a building, ultimately rendering the docking plan impractical.
887	15720	6	3	In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, a lot of problems were faced in allowing the dirigibles to dock there. The obstacles that were faced would put people's safety at risk. One of the problems was the tail of the dirigibles would swivel because of how high up it was; the wind would be violent. Another problem that was stated in paragraph @NUM1 was foreign dirigibles were made with hydrogen instead of helium, so they were flammable, creating a dangerous situation for those working at the mooring mast. These challenges highlighted the risks associated with accommodating these massive airships.
888	15721	6	3	"Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. When designing the mast, they didn't realize that the mast ""would add stress to the building's frame,"" and in order to fix this problem, they would have to pay ""over sixty thousand Dollars' worth"" for modifications for the building's framework. Another problem they encountered, besides the fact that there was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" was that ""the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting."" This did not allow dirigibles to be able to get close enough to dock, in fear that the ""wind would blow the dirigible onto sharp spires,"" which would damage the dirigible's shell and potentially cause further complications. An alternate problem faced by builders was realized when the Hindenburg was destroyed in New Jersey, due to the fact that ""hydrogen is extremely flammable."" They realized how unsafe it would be to have an accident like that ""above a densely populated area."" And so, builders were forced to stop their work on the dirigible docking station, recognizing the myriad of safety and logistical challenges that made the ambitious plan ultimately impractical."
889	15722	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems attempting to dock dirigibles. Most of these problems were safety concerns. One issue was the use of hydrogen, a highly flammable and explosive gas. A fire accident would be catastrophic, since downtown New York is densely populated. Another problem was that the tail of the dirigible could not be weighted down as it usually is, because then there would be massive weights dangling over the streets. With the winds blowing and the blimp not securely tethered, and not weighted, dirigibles would have swayed and moved around dangerously. That creates the risk of the blimp getting punctured by sharp edges on other buildings, potentially causing leaks. Also, if the blimp ever successfully moored it would create tremendous stress on the building's structure. Besides the technical issues there were some obvious obstacles that oddly never got considered or addressed. The first being a law prohibiting low-altitude flights of airships over urban centers, which made it illegal to even attempt a landing, meaning there was never any remote chance of the mooring mast functioning. The second problem was that the proper mooring equipment was never installed, so no attempt could ever succeed. The builders faced many obstacles building the mast, but their biggest obstacle was lack of preparation, and the failure to address obvious problems, ultimately rendering the entire endeavor impractical.
890	15723	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced two obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle was the forceful winds. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents at that altitude. Even tethering the dirigible to the mooring mast would cause the back of the ship to swivel dangerously around the mooring mast, creating a hazardous situation for passengers and the building itself. The second obstacle was due to an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even approach the area, effectively preventing the envisioned airship docking from ever becoming a reality.
891	15724	6	3	"@CAPS1 numerous and complex. In @CAPS2 1930 @NUM1 it reads that ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's frame work."" This @CAPS3 indicated that the designings of the Mast was going to take some time. Another obstacle almost called the end of the mooring mast. In @CAPS2 1931 @NUM2 Architects @CAPS5 admitted that, "" The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its @CAPS6 intended pose, for reasons that a pparent befrore it was even constructed.' The greates reason was one safety: Most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION3 United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flamable."" @CAPS7 Because this was such a huge @CAPS8 concern, the owners thought of the densely populated area of New York and how People could get hurt. Ultimately, the combination of structural modifications, lengthy design times, and significant safety concerns, particularly the risk of using flammable hydrogen, proved insurmountable, preventing the mooring mast from ever serving its intended purpose."
892	15725	6	3	The obstacles that builders faced while building the Empire State Building was, first the buildings structure was not strong enough, the winds were too strong, and the law. The buildings structure could not hold a 200 foot dirigible. The winds would make the dirigible move, which could also ruin the frame of the building, making docking dangerous. Also the law said that the airships could not fly too low over a city. That was some of the obstacles that the workers faced while building the Empire State Building, ultimately making the dirigible mooring mast idea impractical.
893	15726	6	3	Upon taking up the task of building a mast for dirigibles to dock at, the architects encountered many obstacles which made the idea of a mooring mast unplausible. One obstacle they ran into was the violent nature of the wind currents above the city. If the dirigibles were to dock at the building with a tether, then the back would be free to swing and sway, potentially colliding with nearby structures. Another factor they had to consider is that dirigibles are full of the flamable gas hydrogen which imposed the risk of a serious fire hazzard about New York City, a catastrophic event waiting to happen. Even if the engineers and architects managed to work out all of the kinks of building the mast, they still would face another obstacle. It was illegal to fly dirigibles to low over urban areas, due to safety concerns. These are the reasons why the idea of a dock for dirigibles could never work out. The convergence of these factors ultimately rendered the ambitious concept of a dirigible dock an impractical endeavor.
894	15727	6	3	The engineers of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. By allowing the dirigibles to dock there, They had to build mooring masts on the side of the building, which means that they would be putting their life's in danger. They also had to deal with the electrical problems within and without the building. The electricians on the outsides of the building would have to deal with the strong wind currents. They also have to make sure that the electrical system was working properly. If there were to be a spark of any sort of fire, the hydrogen and helium were extremely flammable, and if a wire were too short, it could light the whole dirigible aflame and it would blow up, highlighting the serious safety concerns associated with the ambitious project.
895	15728	6	3	The Empire State Building faced unexpected difficulties to have the dirigibles dock there as initially planned. Wind pressure exerted by the large dirigibles posed a threat, messing up the building's framework. To accommodate the situation and mitigate these risks, they paid over sixty thousand dollars to strengthen the building's framework, ultimately hoping to realize the vision of aerial docking.
896	15729	6	3	"Based on the excerpt the builders of the Empire State Building were faced with many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some of the obstacles were safety factors and nature its self. Safety was a big obstacle in this plan for a mooring mast because the dirigibles used hydrogen to float these big ships. Hydrogen is highly flammable and the owners of the Empire State Building realized how bad it would be if the dirigibles were to catch on fire over a highly populated city like New York. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, May 6, 1937, the owners realized how much worse that accident could have been in New York."" The greatest obstacle was nature. Humans couldn't control wind and on top of the building they were constantly changing making it hard to dock. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" With such volatile conditions and the inherent dangers of hydrogen, the mooring mast plan was ultimately deemed impractical and abandoned, demonstrating the triumph of safety concerns and natural forces over ambitious engineering."
897	15730	6	3	Mooring mast was added to the top of the building where it would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers on and off. Dirigibles were docked by an electric winch. The body of the dirigibles swang in the breeze. One set of engineers in New York tried to dope out a practical solution. They worked really hard. The Government people in Washington were figuring on some system of mooring airships to the mast. They eventually were successful on what they were trying to accomplish by building a mooring mast so that the dirigibles would have a place to land for fuel and service, proving the viability of such a structure.
898	15731	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles docked there. One of these obstacles was the lack of a suitable landing area, considering the dirigibles were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City. Another obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it potentially illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even approach. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. Furthermore, even if they got close enough, the captain couldn’t release the controls, fearing the wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of nearby buildings, puncturing its shell. Finally, over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework for the dirigible project to even be attempted. These significant challenges ultimately proved the impracticality of the dirigible docking plan.
899	15732	6	3	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building. First they had to make sure that the mast wasn't too heavy to put on top of the building and when they realized it was they made a number of modifications to the building so that it could support the mast. They also had to make sure it would be safe, transporting people through this dirigible, considering factors like wind speed at such heights. It depended on the wind and climate. They also had to make the building taller than the Chrysler building. They wanted to transform New York air transportation. In the end, they realized that docking on the building was not possible if they wanted to keep everything safe to the public."
900	15733	6	3	The Mooring Mast excerpt went through unexpected obstacles such as high winds. If the men were not trying to compete, the buildings would probably have been okay. If you take your time and really try to reach your goal, you can achieve it. Therefore, patience and collaboration often yield better results.
901	15734	6	3	"In the article ""The mooring mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced in ATTEMPTING to allow dirigibles to dock there was safety. ""The owner of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"". Another example why the builders faced difficulties in ATTEMPTING to allow dirigibles to dock there was that ""open landing field could be weighted down in the back with lead weight, dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe"". The Empire State Building plan was not very safe. This is why the builders of the Empire State Building faced challenges in ATTEMPTING to allow dirigibles to dock there, ultimately making the plan unfeasible due to safety concerns."
902	15735	6	3	In the 1930's people did not have technology like we have today, they didn't know what they were really even doing. When the architects were building The Empire State Building they had many problems. First, they couldn't just drop a mast on there because, as they said in the story, the roof was not flat. Next, it said a thousand foot drop would add stress to the frame, and last, they had to change the frame from steel to glass and they also had to change the roof design somewhat. All in all, men in the 1930's had a lot of work to do while building the Empire State Building, showcasing their ingenuity despite technological limitations.
903	15736	6	3	The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose for reasons such as safety, nature, and the laws. The greatest reason was safety because most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is very flammable, posing a significant risk. The German dirigible, Hindenburg, was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937. This accident could have been much worse if it happened in a densely populated area like downtown New York. Nature was the biggest obstacle to get around because the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This would cause the back of the ship to swivel around, creating a hazardous situation. This is not good because it would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street. Finally, there are laws against airships flying too low over urban areas. That law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. In conclusion, because of these three major reasons, the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose.
904	15737	6	3	The builder of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, noticing that the dirigibles would be unsafely dangling high above pedestrians on the street. There were many risks when landing the huge dirigibles, and also a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to even approach the area. Famous and important dirigibles had lots of trouble with their landing; for example, in December 1930, the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough because of forceful winds. The dirigible could move uncontrollably and crash into the sharp spires on other buildings around it. In spite of becoming the mode of transportation of the future, dirigibles had given way to airplanes.
905	15738	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock there are many, mainly it is a safety concern. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"", stated the article. ""They would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street [which] was neither practical nor safe."" This shows the dirigibles are impractical and a danger to both the people in it and the people on the street below. The vision of quick transatlantic travel directly into the city's heart proved to be more fantasy than reality due to these considerable dangers."
906	15739	6	3	The greatest obstacles the builder of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was one of safety. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937 the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. The sheer number of people in the area amplified the potential for disaster. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making docking a dangerous proposition. The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over crowded areas. The wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell; the captain could not even take his hands off the control levers, making passenger transfer impossible and ultimately sealing the fate of the ambitious plan.
907	15740	6	3	"In the story ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, there were many problems to face to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building. These obstacles composed of the dirigibles themselves, nature's winds, and laws that prevented dirigibles being allowed to dock. Some dirigibles from outside the state used hydrogen, a flammable gas, and could cause mass destruction to New York City due to being about the same length as four blocks in New York City. Wind caused the dirigibles to swivel around even after being tied down, making the docking procedure precarious. Since there ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" doing so could cause the captain of the dirigible to be arrested, further complicating matters. These combined issues ultimately made the ambitious mooring mast project impractical and short-lived."
908	15741	6	3	"The obstacles the builders faced in building the Empire State Building were nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The height and planned use of the building presented unique challenges. ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" The size was a problem along with how high they were in the sky, especially considering mooring airships. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" These factors demonstrate how environmental and design considerations intertwined to create significant hurdles during the construction process."
909	15742	6	3	"In this excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced, in attempting dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle they faced, was that they lacked a suitable landing area. Because of this, they came up with the idea of having the passengers get on and off the dirigible by walking down a gangplank to an open observation platform. Another obstacle they faced, was that ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" Another main obstacle that the builders faced was that ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" In the end, the idea of the mooring mast, was a failure. The builders didnt think about potential problems that could occur. For example, nature itself, the law against airships flying too low over urban areas, and even fires, due to the gas (hydrogen) used in some dirigibles. Ultimately, these oversights contributed to the impracticality of the mooring mast and its eventual abandonment, proving that even the most ambitious plans can be undone by unforeseen challenges."
910	15743	6	3	If the Empire State Building were to dock dirigibles, there would be many problems in the way. They had a lack of landing area for an almost one-thousand foot blimp, as the mooring mast was simply not large enough. This dirigible being held by a single tether to the Empire State Building would put a large amount of stress on the building's structure, risking a possible collapse if continued over time. If they were to use the Empire State Building, they would have to modify it substantially and use thousands of dollars in the process for reinforcements. Even then, if the dirigible held onto the Building, the back of the blimp would sway with the high winds at that altitude, and that might risk the safety of the passengers trying to disembark. All in all, the idea of landing a dirigible on a gigantic building is just a bad idea, and the experiment ultimately proved to be impractical and dangerous.
911	15744	6	3	Dirigible docking would have been a great addition to the Empire State Building. There were many obstacles the architects had to go through to complete this goal. The building wasn't strong enough. If they had tied a dirigible to the top of the original Empire State Building, it would have pulled the building until it fell over. The architects had to upgrade the frame so it was safe. Now that the frame was safe they had to worry about the dirigible itself. If only one end of the dirigible was tied to the mast, the other end would blow in the wind, making unloading cargo and people very hard, if not impossible. Also, dirigibles could catch fire, which wasn't safe for the people on the ground, or for those attempting to disembark. In the end it just wasn't safe to dock a dirigible at the Empire State Building.
912	15745	6	3	While the Empire State Building was being built the builders faced many obstacles. Al Smith, the one in charge of this project, had a goal to build the tallest building. Right of the bat, the first problem occurred. The Chrysler Building had a secret 185-foot spire inside, and made this building now in 1930, 46 ft taller then the Empire State Building. The first sign of hope shined apon Al when he saw an opportunity for Empire State Building. Dirigibles needed a landing area and the mooring mast does the trick. The mast, added to the top of the building, allows dirigibles to anchor For awhile to refuel and to have service done. This design took a while to develop and soon became bad. Saftey was a factor. Most dirigibles, from outside of the United States, were run on hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is very flammable and can cause tragic accedents. For example on May 6, 1937 German dirigible was destroyed by fire in New Jersey. If something like that would happen in a heavily populated area like New York City then there would be a problem. These were a couple of the many obstacles faced while building the Empire State Building.
913	15746	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The obstacles included safety issues, nature and the law. Safety issues was a problem because in the excerpt it says, ""Most dirigibles from outside United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This explains why they couldn't do it because if one of the dirigibles would explode in downtown New York it would cause severe damage and losses of life because it's a populated area. Another obstacle was nature. Nature played its role because ""the winds on top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents."" These high winds and unpredictable gusts would have made maneuvering the large airships extremely difficult, if not impossible, making docking a dangerous proposition. This would have made the back of the dirigibles swivel around which was neither practical nor safe. The last obstacle was that there was a law about airships flying too low over urban areas. This would have made it illegal to tie a ship to the Empire State Building. These obstacles had made the builders face problems to allow dirigibles to land on the Empire State Building, ultimately preventing the realization of that ambitious vision."
914	15747	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced obstacles attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first big obstacle was designing the mast. Architects couldn't just drop a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State building; it had a flat roof, requiring careful integration. If a dirigible was moored it would add additional stress to the frame, and wind pressure would be a factor as well, demanding structural reinforcement. The mooring mast was never destined to fulfill the purpose of landing dirigibles, because it isn't safe, nature (dirigible with swivel in back) it could possibly be weighed down by lead in back but that cant be hung above pedestrians on the street. A practical reason why they could not moor was a particular law already in place against air ships flying to low. Although, this had happened, two dirigibles had attempted to moor there; the first turned back due to bad weather conditions, and the second one was as a publicity stunt had dropped off newspapers before the landing gear could be installed so they had to use a wire to recieve them. In result the entire idea was shelved, deemed impractical and ultimately abandoned.
915	15748	6	3	The obstacles the builders faced was mainly safety. Safety was important because of how many people there are in New York. Another problem was the dirigibles outside the United States were hydrogen instead of helium, which increased the risk of fire. At such a high height the wind is very strong and the blimps are only being held by the front while the back would swing uncontrolably. A blimp can easily be blown into a close building's sharp spires and pop because of winds. There are alot of things that could go wrong at any time, so I think the right decision was to stop the idea of the mooring mast. Given these dangers and potential for disaster, discontinuing the project prioritized public well-being.
916	15749	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced is dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mast, though this plan ultimately proved unworkable.
917	15750	6	3	Well the dirigibles were airships flying too low over the city and over urban areas. Also the U.S. Navy dirigible approached the mooring mast to tie up but the winds were too forceful. Also, a Goodyear Blimp, the Columbia, attempted a publicity stunt where it tied up and delivered a bundle of newspapers, ultimately demonstrating the challenges and limitations of airship operations in urban environments.
918	15751	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when trying to make it safe for dirigibles to dock there. Three main issues they faced were adding stress to the building, safety, and urban laws. The Empire State Building was already huge & fragile so adding a lot of weight to it, would not have helped, ""a 800 foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether would add stress to the building's frame."" The architects could not want this, they had to make changes to mitigate the additional weight. Before they made the changes, they also realized that it was extremely windy up there, ""winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Ultimately, it would not be safe to be up there, never knowing how bad the winds would be. So they decided to make the building shorter, in hopes of making conditions more manageable. After all the work they put in, it still wasn't good enough because there was a law that was ""against airships flying too low over urban areas."" After all the time and hard work they put in, there was, in the end, no way to have this idea be successful."
919	15752	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building had obstacles in their way. There were Dirigibles that were one thousand feet long and they had an obstacle which was that they did not have much space in New York to land. Al Smith decided that was a good idea to let dirigibles anchor on top of his building for some hours for ""refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on."" But the dirigibles were docked by an electric winch that tied the ship to the mast. The dirigibles would swing, and people would still get on and off safely. Architects and engineers of the Empire State Building worked/talked with experts and got equipment ""and mooring operations oat the U.S. Naval Air Station,"" since the Navy was the leader in the development of dirigibles in the U.S. and knew everything about them. The Navy even offered its dirigibles to be used for testing the mast atop the building. Also, the architect met with the president of an airship transport company that offered a dirigibles service across the Pacific ocean. In conclusion, the builders faced many challenges and explored various strategies in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
920	15753	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 people faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there is they would have to make new routes that were yet to be made and adapt existing transatlantic routes; this necessity presented a significant challenge in integrating the new mode of transportation.
921	15754	6	3	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was trying to moor a dirigible at the top without stressing the building too much. It says, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation."" This means they planned to deal with this problem by spreading this stress all the way to the foundation of the building, a feat that posed significant engineering challenges. Another obstacle that was faced was trying to keep the dirigibles from moving and swaying too much, once they were moored. It says, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" It was impossible to keep the dirigibles from moving because the wind was so violent, making for a turbulent and unpredictable docking experience. The last problem was that even if they could get a dirigible to moor to the building, it was illegal to fly the airships that low in an urban area. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" In conclusion, all of these obstacles that the builders faced led to the final result of being unsuccessful in their ambitious plan to turn the Empire State Building into an airship docking station."
922	15755	6	3	The Empire State Building faced alot of promblems before it came out as an architectural marvel. They were scared that other people would destroy this Building, so they reduced the dirigibles to dock there. They wanted their city to become a famous city and get more money, but another problem was that some people didn't care and postponed its construction to later. These hurdles, however, were ultimately overcome, leading to the completion of the iconic structure.
923	15756	6	3	"The idea of docking a one thousand feet long dirigible to a mast eleven-hundred feet above the ground never seemed possible. From the factual evidence provided in paragraphs @NUM1 and @NUM2, the theory is proven failure. ""Dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen which is highly flammable."" If a dirigible caught fire trying to dock at the Empire State building, the accident would quickly turn into a catastrophe, with flames and debris raining down on the city. ""The greatest obstacle was nature itself."" The high-speed and shifting winds atop the Empire State building would cause mooring dirigibles to brandish around the mast, making docking incredibly dangerous. Another obstacle the builders of the Empire State building faced was the law forbidding air vessels of flying too low over urban areas, further complicating the approach and docking procedures. A problem that would condemn the theory from the start and ensure it was never a practical solution."
924	15757	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles with allowing dirigibles to dock there. For one thing, they were mainly ""hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" A fire in one of these would be devastating being over an enormous city like New York. The wind currents would also make it impossible to dock there. ""The ship would swivel around the mooring mast,"" and could even potentially puncture the frame. The whole idea was dangerous and risky. In fact, it would have been illegal for flying ""too low over urban areas."" Not only was it dangerous, but against the law too. Overall, these were the obstacles that workers faced, and the obstacles that won out in the long run, ultimately rendering the dirigible docking station a failed endeavor."
925	15758	6	3	"In building the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles in the process of letting dirigibles moor at the mooring mast. In the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the author gives us examples as to what was difficult. One obstacle in the docking of dirigibles to the mast was safety for the people inside. The article says, ""The greatest reason was one of safety."" It then goes on to say ""Most dirigibles from out of the U.S used Hydrogen, Hydrogen is highly flammable."" This presented a significant risk. Another reason was nature. The author states ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would lead to an insecure departure of passengers, as boarding and deboarding would be hazardous. The article also says ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel"" which shows unsafe air conditions that could easily throw people off balance. These are two obstacles that made landing at the mooring mast very difficult and soon made it impossible, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the project."
926	15759	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. The dirigibles weren't safe in a city like New York because of violent wind currents at the top of the building that would make the dirigibles ""swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" making docking extremely hazardous. Also many blimps from outside the United States were filled with hydrogen, which is highly flammable. If there was an accident like the Hindenburg in New York, more than just the passengers would be harmed; the densely populated city would be at great risk. Another obstacle was that there was a law forbidding airships to fly too low over urban areas, due to safety concerns. This law made it illegal for ships to even go near the Empire State Building, essentially ending any practical considerations for using the mooring mast."
927	15760	6	3	Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced problems such as too much wind movement, too much weight, and too many safety risks when they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. The wind movement would move the dirigibles around when trying to dock, so they would have troubles with that. They would also have weight problems because they didn't have a stable enough frame around the building to support the weight of a dirigible. They would have to pay a lot of money to fix this problem, potentially requiring significant structural reinforcement. The last problem was a safety problem. After the German dirigible Hindenburg blew up, they realized that it was way too dangerous to have blimps landing over crowded cities. It was also a flying law of airships not being able to go that low over a city. These factors combined to ultimately make the dirigible docking plan unfeasible, highlighting the significant challenges the builders faced.
928	15761	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State building faced the obstacles of the use of hydrogen in dirigibles in which is highly flammable, nature itself, and an existing law in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. It stated in paragraph @NUM1 of the excerpt, most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen, which is very flammable. Realizing that this kind of happening above an outrageously populated area such as New York City would be extremely dangerous. To explicate, ""when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident would have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"". However, the greatest obstacle was nature itself. At the top of the building, the winds were constantly shifting, which was certainly not safe. For example, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" The builders soon realized that this issue could unfortunately, not be resolved. Lastly, a more apparent obstacle that the builders faced was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for the ships to even approach the area. Ultimately, the combination of the dangers of hydrogen, the unpredictable nature of the winds, and the legal restrictions made it impossible for Al Smith's plan for the Empire State Building to serve as a functional mooring mast to become realistic."
929	15762	6	3	"Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles well attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the ""violent air-currents"" at such a height. Due to these currents, it became very hard to be able to allow a dirigible to dock at the top of the Empire State Building, without it blowing away, making the entire process incredibly difficult to manage safely. Another obstacle was safety regarding the very nature of dirigibles themselves. The dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, instead of helium, a safer alternative. Hydrogen is a very flammable object and if an accident were to happen, a flaming balloon flying over a highly populated area of New York could become very dangerous, with potentially catastrophic results. Although the idea of making docking stations for dirigibles is a good idea in theory, there are too many obstacles and hazards preventing it from ever happening practically."
930	15763	6	3	"The builders faced many obstacles in attempting to ensure that dirigibles could dock at the Empire State Building. For example, the first problem that arose was construction of the mast atop the building. According to the excerpt, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" From this you immediately know that the frame of the Empire State Building would have to be properly modified in order for the dirigible to safely and successfully dock at the mast. Another minor issue was making the whole construction look decorative. ""... the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside..."" This made the mast aesthetically pleasing. The reality was that any practical use of the mast was wishful thinking. @CAPS1 ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" @CAPS2, the winds at that altitude would have been to unstable for a dirigible to dock. The problem is that the winds could potentially ""swing"" the rear of the dirigible around the mast, which is extremely dangerous and risky. Ultimately, the dream of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building proved to be more fantasy than feasibility due to these significant challenges."
931	15764	6	3	"During the construction of the Empire State Building, builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow a dirigible to dock there. These problems consisted of safety and practical issues. One safety issue was that most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium; hydrogen was more flammable than helium, posing a significant risk. This concern was tragically validated when the Hindenburg, a German airship, was destroyed by fire. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The builders also had practical issues, such as the existing law against airships flying too low over a city. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This made it illegal for a ship to even tie up to the building."" Ultimately, these safety concerns and legal restrictions meant that the plan for dirigibles landing on the Empire State Building was not viable, preventing the realization of this ambitious vision."
932	15765	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to let the dirigibles dock there. One obstacle the builders faced was the ""lack of a suitable landing area,"" which made it difficult for the large airships to maneuver safely. (paragraph six) A second obstacle is the amount of stress a dirigible would put onto the building. As the author states in paragraph nine, ""the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation."" This immense weight and pressure posed a significant engineering challenge. The author also states that in order for the invention to work out, the Empire State building's steel frame would have to have more strength to it and it would have to be modified to accommodate the new idea. The greatest obsticle faced was due to the nature of where the building was located. Because of the location, the winds were so strong and the wind shifted constantly, making docking a dangerous proposition. The last obsticle the builders faced was ""a law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" These regulations further restricted the feasibility of the project. By the late nineteen thirtie's, the idea landing dirigibles on the Empire State Building disappeared. Instead, the idea of air transportation was given to airplanes. In the end, the combined weight of these challenges proved too great, and the vision of the Empire State Building as a dirigible dock never came to fruition."
933	15766	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced made it hard to build the Mooring. One problem they faced was that most of the dirigibles made outside of the @PERSON1 Used hydrogen rather than helium. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire, the owners of the Empire state building realized how much worse it would be if that happened in New York city which is highly populated."" @CAPS1 obstacle was mother Nature. Winds at the top of the building were constantly changing. In paragraph @NUM2 the author states ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" The last obstacle was laws against airships flying too low over urban areas. In paragraph @NUM3 the author states ""this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"". The combination of these factors, including safety concerns, unpredictable weather, and legal restrictions, ultimately made the mooring mast impractical."
934	15767	6	3	"Obstacles such as nature, safety issues, and weight as well as length of the dirigible were obstacles that the builders of the Empire State building faced in trying to allow dirigibles to dock on it. They were very hopeful in the idea of having the Empire State building, ""equipped for an age of transportation that was then only the dream of aviation pioneers,"" until they saw the risks. First was nature itself, winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents high above the city. This means that the dirigible, which was made to be, ""lighter than air,"" would swivel around the mooring mass, making docking incredibly difficult, and have no weight support to keep it down. Sometimes, the winds might even prevent the dirigible to get close enough like in 1931 when a U.S. Navy dirigible named Los Angeles approached the mooring mass but couldn't get close enough due to strong winds. Another issue with safety was paramount. It was stated that outside of the U.S., most dirigibles use hydrogen instead of helium, which was used in the U.S. Hydrogen is highly flammable, which is a very dangerous asset when there are millions of people down below. When the owners of the Empire State Building heard about the German dirigible the Hindenburg that was destroyed by fire, they imagined that situation over New York which was highly populated, a chilling prospect. Lastly was the size and weight of the dirigible itself. The dirigible (800 ft) held by single cable would add stress to the building's frame. In order to prevent this, they would have to modify the frame, adding significantly to the cost. These obstacles plus many more showed that that this idea was, ""destined to never fulfill its purpose,"" and the vision of aerial commuting faded away."
935	15768	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building face a couple challenges in trying to build a dock for dirigibles on it. One main problem was that it was clearly unsafe because dirigibles from outside the United States often used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is very flammable, and they didn't want to have another accident like the Hindenburg disaster, which dramatically illustrated the dangers of hydrogen-filled airships. They realized that if a similar accident had happened atop the Empire State Building, in a densely populated area such as New York, it would have been a thousand times worse, leading to catastrophic loss of life and widespread panic.
936	15769	6	3	"How safe is it to have a large dirigible @CAPS1 above thousands of civilians? The builders had many problems to face while attempting to allow the dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. For one thing, the mast was not yet even said to be ready in this excerpt: ""to fix a mast at such a height made it desireable to postponed to a later date."" The landing gear was also not yet ready or sure to work. The idea of using dirigibles over such a crowded area was not even said to be relevantly smart, especially considering the various mechanical uncertainties involved in securing such a large airship. Ultimately, the safety of dirigibles operating above densely populated areas remained questionable given these unresolved engineering and logistical concerns."
937	15770	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that most dirigibles from Outside of the United States used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The risk of fire was deemed unacceptable. When a German dirigible was destroyed by fire in New Jersey, the owners of the Empire State Building realized it would be much more dangerous in a crowded area. A second obstacle was that the dirigible would be swivelling around the mast because of violent air currents. The dirigible would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, which is definitely not safe. A third obstacle was that there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. Thankfully, by the late 1930s, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles had quickly disappeared, and the builders had no more obstacles to face. Thus, a potentially dangerous and impractical plan was abandoned.
938	15771	6	3	"The idea of Hindenburg sized air ships landing on top of the Empire State Building sounds preposterous in today's day and age. However in the 1920s this was a dream of many. Unfortunately this dream never came to be due to multiple obstacles faced by the builders. The first obstacle faced by the builders concerned what was in the air ship itself, hydrogen. This would be a problem because the vast majority of blimps visiting ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"". So if an accident ""had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" it could be disastrous. Another major problem were the winds. They were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" and so the ships could swing into other buildings. These two points aside, there was an ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" anyways. So regardless of the wind or the hydrogen it wasn't legal. These three obstacles combined made the dream of airships landing in New York stay a dream and not a reality."
939	15772	6	3	"In the story ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building had many obstacles in the attempt of allowing dirigibles to dock. The huge balloon caused tension and stress due to its ginormous size. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of abuilding, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"". The immense stress of the dirigible could cause crucial damage to the building's frame, potentially compromising its structural integrity. Also, it was not only the size, but the contents of some of the planes caused a crisis as well. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"". The worries of the balloon catching on fire was too much to risk due to the potential for a catastrophic explosion. Along with all this, is the power of nature itself. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" The winds on top of the building were very violent compared to the ones in the ground, causing a scare for anyone attempting to dock. It looked all good until everything was looked at carefully; obstacles came from all different ways, ultimately making the endeavor far too risky to pursue."
940	15773	6	3	"The majestic spire of the Empire State Building is familiar to many people throughout the world, but not many know that the original purpose of the mast was to serve as a landing spot For dirigibles also known as blimps. The builders of the Empire State building faced a myriad of obstacles. It is proven when it says ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building Flat Roof... A Thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable Tether, would add stress to the Buildings frame"". They took a risk in having the dirigibles tied to the Empire State building, which can cause pressure to the building which soon might clasp. Another factor that proves that the builders Empire State faced, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature its self"" The winds on top of the building made it dangerous. Clearly there were obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced, and ultimately these challenges led to the abandonment of the dirigible mooring concept."
941	15774	6	3	"In the excerpt from The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lusted, builders faced many obstacles in the attempt to allow the dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. In paragraph one of the excerpt it states, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" The stress of the wind and dirigible's weight would have to be transmitted to the foundation of the building, about eleven hundred feet below, posing significant structural challenges. In paragraph two of the excerpt it states, ""most dirigibles... used hydrogen rather than helium, and the hydrogen is highly flammable."" If another disaster happened like the Hindenburg (which was destroyed by fire) in an area heavily populated like New York, above a large building with many people, it would be a thousand times worse, creating an unthinkable catastrophe. The winds above the Empire State Building were constantly changing because of violent air currents. This left the designers to deal with the problem of a dirigible swinging around the mooring mast, making the docking procedure incredibly dangerous and unpredictable. In the excerpt from The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lusted the builders faced so many obstacles that they eventually abandoned the project, deeming it ultimately impractical and unsafe."
942	15775	6	3	"On December 11, 1929, Al Smith had the idea to make the Empire State Building the tallest building in the U.S.. He wanted to out-do the Chrysler Building, Smith wanted it to be 1,250 feet. His idea was to add a mooring mast. However, issues got in the way such as how highly flamable blimps were, how densely populated the city was, and the violent shifting winds. Blimps are highly flammable because they contain both hydrogen and helium. On May 6, 1937, a German dirigible, the Hindenburg, was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, demonstrating the danger. New York City has millions of tourists a day, in such a populated area what if something went horribly wrong. The greatest issue was nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents... the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast."" (@CAPS1, @NUM1). On May 6, 1937 owners of the building concluded that efforts to make the Empire State Building a functional mooring station was neither practical nor safe, and the mooring mast idea was abandoned."
943	15776	6	3	"During the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock in the Empire State Building, builders faced many obstacles. One of these obstacles was to modify the whole frame of the building. ""A thousand- foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame... The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" This quote from the excerpt clearly shows that the builders would have to work around this structural challenge to complete their job, which would entirely make this situation an obstacle. Another obstacle faced by the workers was nature itself, specifically the unpredictable weather conditions at such a height. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This quote shows another obstacle because builders could not find a practical way to safely and consistently get the passengers off the airships in such turbulent conditions, and weighing down the dirigible with lead would only endanger the pedestrians below. The final obstacle the builders faced was the safety of everyone involved, both in the air and on the ground. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This quote shows a very big obstacle, highlighted by the tragic fate that actually happened to the German dirigible Hindenburg, underscoring the dangers of hydrogen-filled airships. Those were the significant obstacles that were faced by the workers during the ambitious, but ultimately unsuccessful, attempt to dock dirigibles on the Empire State Building."
944	15777	6	3	Many obstacles occurred for the builders of the Empire State Building and allowing dirigibles to dock there. One of these obstacles was the mooring mast itself, specifically how it would interact with the airships. The winds on top of the Empire State Building were constantly shifting, and if the dirigible was tied to the mooring mast, it would swivel around the mast, potentially causing damage. Another obstacle the builders experienced during this process was the already existing law not allowing airships to fly too low over urban areas. Due to the fact that the Empire State Building was in New York, an urban area, the dirigible idea would have most likely never worked because it would have been against air traffic regulations. The dirigible was unable to fulfill its destiny, and the obstacles the builders faced were the main reasons the ambitious docking plan was ultimately abandoned.
945	15778	6	3	There are some obstacles the builders face during this time while building the Empire State Building. One of the issues was the unsolved problems of mooring airships to fix a mast at a height desirable to postpone installation to a later date. The Empire State Building wasn't destined to ever fulfill its purpose, for reasons it should have been apparent before it was constructed, such as dangerous high winds and the sheer difficulty of maneuvering large airships in a crowded urban environment. And another obstactle was the lack of a suitable landing area nearby to accommodate passengers and cargo efficiently, further contributing to the impracticality of the airship mooring concept.
946	15779	6	3	"There were several obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One reason was one of safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The builders knew that if an accident were to occur above a densely populated area, such as New York, it would be catastrophic. Another obstacle was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" making docking incredibly difficult and dangerous. Another obstacle the builders had was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, further complicating the already challenging logistical and safety concerns. These converging issues ultimately led to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan."
947	15780	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building faced obstacles such as weather, chemistry, and construction issues in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, the height of the building meant that, ""the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". Due to the violent wind currents, the backs of the dirigibles would constantly orbit around the mast, creating a precarious and uncontrollable situation. Another problem that the builders of the Empire State Building faced was the gases that most dirigibles were made of. Most of the dirigibles from outside the country were made out of the gas hydrogen: an incredibly flammable gas. This problem was exhibited by the German dirigible Hindenburg that was destroyed by a fire, highlighting the dangers of hydrogen-filled airships. With this misfortune, the owners of the Empire State building noticed ""how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as a downtown New York"". With this realization, the builders of the Empire State Building finally came to realize that a dirigible dangling high above the street was not safe or a practical idea. Lastly, the construction of the building itself posed a problem the obstacles of the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would put stress upon the frame of the building and would be incredibly expensive to modify. However, the builders fixed this problem at the cost of sixty thousand dollars. Unfortunately, the other problems with the construction were too great, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan due to safety and logistical concerns."
948	15781	6	3	"Complex. A building is a complex structure that cannot be easily tampered with, and still be considered safe. That is the major problem the builders had. It isn't easy you ""could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof"" (Popular Science @NUM1). They had to strengthen the structure and that took ""sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications"" (Popular Science ∂ @NUM1). Plus the builders had to design a nice plan for the mast, to make it look nice. They even had to use glass which is a harder material to work with. Although the greatest obstacle the builders had was allowing the dirigible to dock. One it was filled with hydrogen which is highly flammable, and if it ever blew up it would have killed a lot of people in the city. However ""the greatest obstacle to successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"" (Popular Science ∂@NUM3). This was mentioned in Popular Science @NUM3 and is the main reason why the idea failed. The winds were always constantly shifting, which caused the back to swivel and become unsafe. Weights on the back would have made it even more dangerous, because they could fall. Lastly laws prevented flight so close to the ground. But even so many other blimps tried, like ""Columbia"" and ""Los Angeles"", and found it was too hard to fly that close to building and dock as well. The idea had many holes in it, making its execution ultimately unfeasible."
949	15782	6	3	"In the excerpt, they tell some reasons why it would be difficult for dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State building. In paragraph 6, it says, ""Dirigibles were docked by means of electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and tied to a mast. The body of the dirigible could swing in the breeze, and yet passengers could safely get on and off the dirigible by walking down a gangplank of the observation deck."" This shows how it could be potentially dangerous for the passengers of the dirigible to get off, especially considering the high altitude and potential for strong winds. Another reason was that dirigibles were losing passengers in the late 1930s due to the airplane. As it is stated in paragraph 7, ""By the late 1930s, the idea of using mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers had quietly disappeared. Dirigibles, instead of becoming the transportation of the future, had given way to airplanes."" That quote shows how dirigibles were losing popularity due to the airplane's faster speeds and greater convenience, ultimately making the Empire State Building's mooring mast an obsolete feature."
950	15783	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles when they tried to build a mast to allow dirigibles to dock there. First of all, some dirigibles were highly flamable because they use hydrogen instead of helium. A German dirigible named Hindenburg was destroyed due to a fire, and once the Empire State Building project managers noticed how much worse it could've been in a higher populated place like New York, their hopes went down a little bit. Another obstacle was one that couldnt be fixed, because it was caused by nature. It was the violent winds. The excerpt stated ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" The only solution was to put lead weights in the back, but then they would be hanging over pedestrians, which is definatly not safe. The last thing that stopped them was a law that was against any airships that flew too low in urban areas, further complicating the docking idea. All in all, the builders faced too many obstacles to build a mast for dirigibles, ultimately making the ambitious plan unfeasible."
951	15784	6	3	Builders had many obstacles to overcome when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One obstacle was the lack of suitable landing area. This obstacle did not stop Al Smith, he saw this as an opportunity to add a mooring mast at the top of the building so dirigibles could anchor there. This idea caused another obstacle, a mooring mast could not possibly be dropped on top of the roof of the building. The stress of the load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. With this the steel frame of the building would have to be modified and strengthened costing $2 million just to change the framework. In the end this mooring mast to dock dirigibles never came through and architects should have seen the potential problems in the beginning.
952	15785	6	3	"In the Mooring Mast, Marcia explains how Al Smith attempts to put a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, to allow dirigibles (blimps) to station there for several hours. The architects faced many obstacles in trying to add a mast onto the design of the Empire State Building. One of these obstacles was remodeling the building, so the weight of the blimp wouldn't stress the foundation. ""A Thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" A different obstacle that delayed the progression of blimps being docked at the top of the Empire State Building, was because of safety issues. Most blimps outside of the U.S. used hydrogen, which was highly flammable, rather than helium. Because New York was highly populated, there was no doubt that there would be frequent fires, which would make docking a blimp a very risky process. Even the owners of the Empire State Building realized this danger, a concern that was further amplified on May 6, 1937, with the Hindenburg disaster, effectively ending any serious consideration of using the mast for its intended purpose."
953	15786	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building, who wished to place a mooring mast at the top of the building, faced many obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there. One such obstacle was safety. Most dirigibles at the time used highly flammable hydrogen, and should a single spark enter the balloon, the entire dirigible would catch fire. Eventually, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how harmful an accident could be if it took place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York,"" and halted construction of the mooring mast. Another obstacle was that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" which would cause the dirigible to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast."" A third reason was that, even should there be some way of holding the dirigible still against all that air pressure, all the stress of holding that dirigible still ""would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation,"" potentially compromising the structural integrity. All these problems contributed to the mooring mast's fate and eventual disuse. Ultimately, the impracticality and inherent dangers proved too great to overcome."
954	15787	6	3	"The first main obstacle that the builders faced was the fact that blimps, even though they have propellers and rudders, are still at the mercy of the wind. And since the wind on top of the building was described as ""Constantly shifting due to violen air currents"" (∂ @NUM1), it would be impossible to keep the blimps stable while it was moored on the Empire State building. Just docking the blimp onto the building was an impossible feet; the only blimp that even tried to dock onto the Empire State building, the naval dirigible Los Angeles, could not get close enough to the building to get the mooring lines on because they where ""Fearing that the wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of the othe building in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell."" (∂ @NUM2) causing the dirigible to fall onto the city. The second main obstacle was the public safety aspect of trying to moore a dirigible on the Empire State building. There were too many things that could go wrong: the blimp could explode like the Hindenburg, or could run into one of the spires on the surrounding buildings and plumet to the ground, potentially killing or severely injuring hundreds of people. Considering these significant challenges related to weather conditions and potential safety hazards, trying to dock a dirigible on the Empire State building was ultimately deemed an impractical idea."
955	15788	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Those obstacles were safety reasons against it, laws that made it illegal, and nature (weather). In order to allow dirigibles to dock on the building, all aspects of the project had to be safe - but they weren't. ""Most dirigibles from outside the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (∂ @NUM1). A German dirigible had caught fire in New Jersey and the Empire State building owners realized how bad a fire could be in downtown New York, which is densely populated. This was a significant concern given the potential for catastrophic loss of life. Secondly, there ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban area"" (∂ @NUM2), which would make even trying to approach the building illegal. This legal hurdle presented a considerable challenge to the entire concept. Lastly, nature was not going to change and suddenly cooperate for one project and it was unpredictable when or if the weather would permit docking. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents... The back of the ship would swivel around... dangling high above pedestrians on the street"" (∂ @NUM3). Sounds safe, or practical? Definitely not. In the end, all of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced were too great to overcome, with safety, legality, and the sheer unpredictability of weather conspiring against them, and the top of the building never became a mooring mast for dirigibles."
956	15789	6	3	"The worker faced many obsticals while building the Empire State Building. Sence Al Smith was trying to compete with the Chrysler Building for the tallest building he kept adding on to the Empire State Building. To make his building the tallest in the world he added the mooring mast. This mast would make the Empire State building 1,250 feet tall. The builders had to redesine the entier buildings sceleton. They had to make sure the Empire State Building could hold up the mast. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened."" The builders fixed the steel fram of the building with in two months. The building went on as planned. After awhile the people begin to see that the mas couldn't be used for dirigibles because of the violent wind currents at the top of the building, rendering the initial purpose of the mast impractical and ultimately changing its function."
957	15790	6	3	"When builders were building the Empire State Building they came across many obstacles. One problem was lack of suitable landing area in New York City (paragraph 6). Al Smith came up with the idea to put a mooring mast to the top of the building to allow dirigibles to land there, but there were many problems with this mooring mast. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" (paragraph 7) architects had to strengthen the building's foundation. Over sixty thousand dollars was spent to try and modify the buildings framework. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" (paragraph 8) The winds were shifting and the back of the ship would swivel around, which was not safe. Another reason is that airships flew too low over urban areas. Having a mooring mast for dirigibles to land was dangerous, going against some laws, and a lot of work, ultimately rendering the mooring mast concept impractical and unsafe."
958	15791	6	3	In this excerpt there were obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced. The obstacles they faced were the dirigible and the sucess of the mooring mast. The dirigible were enormous steel framed balloons, with envelopes of cotton fabric. filled with hydrogen and helium to make it lighter than air. unlike the balloon, a dirigible could be maneuvered by the use of propellers and rudders. like a gandala. Another obstacle is the sucessful use of the mooring mast. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air current. It could also weight down and dangle above the pedestrians wasn't safe. Ultimately, these challenges related to airships and docking presented significant hurdles for the Empire State Building's construction. All in all these were the obstacles they had to face.
959	15792	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several problems when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem they faced was that the dirigibles moored to the top of the building would add stress to the building's frame, so the stress of the dirigibles' load would have to be transmitted all the way to the foundation. Another problem they faced was that most dirigibles outside the U.S. used highly flammable hydrogen, so it would be very bad if one was destroyed by fire above densely populated downtown New York. Also, there was already a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, so it would be illegal for a ship to even approach the area, rendering the docking station essentially unusable from a legal standpoint.
960	15793	6	3	The obstacles that the builder's faced were largely avoidable. The first obstacle they faced was the limited landing space they had. If they had thought a little bit longer they most likely could of figured out a way to overcome that problem with better preparation. Now a major point of discussion a couple of obstacles to talked about the fate of the Mast. Everybody including Al Smith should have thought about the safety, it Should have been a first priority. The builder's Should have seen a problem like this coming, with a poor plan to build Something no one has ever done before, showing a lack of foresight that ultimately contributed to the difficulties they encountered.
961	15794	6	3	In the beginning, all the plans made for the Empire State Building seemed perfectly plausible. Dirigibles would tie up to the mast on top of the building and dock there while the passengers got off; easier said then done. Soon enough they began to realize all the flaws in this plan, there were two main problems. After seeing how easily the Hindenburg was destroyed by fire they realize it was too dangerous having dirigibles fly over such a densely populated area such as downtown New York. When the Navy dirigible Los Angeles tried to dock, it could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. It was far to windy for the light dirigibles to stay in place. Along with the wind problem, if somehow a dirigible was able to be tied down the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. Furthermore, unlike dirigible landing fields it was far too risky to dangle weights above the city of New York just to hold the back of the dirigibles down. Unlike previously thought, dirigibles were not the way of the future, airplanes became the newer more efficient way in the late 1930's. A good idea, but as they said: destined to never fulfill its purpose.
962	15795	6	3	The EMPIRE STATE BUILDING faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was the law. There was a law in place preventing airships flying too low over urban cities. This made it illegal for airships to tie up to the building or even come close to the area. Another issue they had was that dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, not helium. Hydrogen is extremely flammable and it would be catastrophic if a dirigible blew up over New York City. The last problem they EXPERIENCED was the wind. At the top of the building the winds shifted due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigibles were tied up the back end would move around. They got the idea to use lead weights on the back but it would not be safe over all those people. Ultimately, these challenges proved insurmountable, and the plan to use the Empire State Building as a dirigible mooring station was abandoned.
963	15796	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building had a grand idea of including a mooring mast where dirigibles, also known as zeppelins or blimps, could dock themselves. Though the idea was good, it provided the builders with many obstacles. For example, when the framework was being built, the mast was going to have to be added to the top. The mast couldn't just be dropped on, however because if a dirigibles were to be moored there, it would put too much stress on the building's framework. This revelation caused them to have to modify the entire framework to make it stronger which was very expensive, adding significantly to the overall cost of the project. Another difficulty the builder's faced, after construction was completed, in allowing dirigibles to dock there was nature. The building was 1,250 feet tall, so the winds up at the top were constantly changing and dangerous, making it difficult for the dirigible remain stationary when moored, thus posing a safety risk to both the airship and the building. Also, something the builders didn't foresee was the laws against blimps flying to low over urban areas. These two challenges ended up making the use of the mooring mast impossible, rendering the expensive modification to the framework a ultimately futile endeavor.
964	15797	6	3	One obstacle that the builders faced was that having dirigibles hanging over a heavily populated area was extremely dangerous, because on May 6, 1937, the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. Another obstacle was that it was illegal to have blimps flying too low over heavily populated areas. So Al Smith had to let go of that plan, rendering the dirigible idea unfeasible due to safety concerns and legal restrictions.
965	15798	6	3	Trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building caused too many obstacles for the builders. Dirigibles were up to one thousand feet long, which would make docking realistically impossible because the sheer size would add immense stress to the building's frame, requiring builders to reconstruct and significantly reinforce the structure. Most non-military dirigibles were filled with hydrogen and not helium, making them highly flammable; if a fire were to erupt, pedestrians below could be seriously injured. Furthermore, an existing law about airships flying too low would make it illegal for a dirigible to even approach the Empire State Building, rendering the entire docking plan infeasible, confirming that the idea was fundamentally impractical.
966	15799	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building were faced with many obstacles to allow dirigible's to dock there. What these builders were facing was a thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, the height of the Empire State Building is 1,250 ft. Adding the single cable tether would add too much stress to the building's frame, so the workers would need to modify and strengthen the building's frame. Another problem they didn't realize at first was the wind, from violent air currents buffeting the massive airships, making docking incredibly dangerous. With all these problems that were not easily fixed, eventually the impractical idea of a dirigible at the top of the Empire State Building disappeared entirely."
967	15800	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" By Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles they faced was the fact that there was a lack of a suitable landing area, as the building was, after all, a skyscraper in a dense urban environment. The dirigibles were thought to be able to anchor on the mooring mast for refueling or service; however, another obstacle was in the way: nature. That was the greatest obstacle. The winds at the top of the building were always shifting because of violent air currents swirling around the structure. The builders were afraid that the back of the ship would ""swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" creating a dangerous situation. With that said, they came to a conclusion that they would be ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street [which] was neither practical or safe."" In order for it to be safe, they came to another obstacle: the entire building would have to be modified and strengthened with over $2 million dollars worth of investment. Lastly, there already stood a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, further complicating the feasibility of the project. With all these obstacles faced, the mooring mast was never opened to the public, and the grand vision of airborne arrivals remained just a dream."
968	15801	6	3	"The main problem the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to let dirigibles dock were the wind conditions and how close dirigibles were to the building. The wind conditions made it hard for the builders to figure out how dirigibles would dock there. The winds near the top of the building were, ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These unpredictable conditions made it nearly impossible to safely moor a large airship. The other problem the builders faced was how close dirigibles came to the building. In one case, as a test run, the Los Angeles tried to approach the mast but it, ""could not get close enough to tie up..."". This highlighted the difficulty dirigibles had in maneuvering so close to the skyscraper. Even though the building was not what it was suppose to be it is still one of the greatest of all time."
969	15802	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a lot of obstacles attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the first obstacles the builders faced was realizing that a dirigible moored at the top of the building would add stress to the building's frame. The builders realized that the wind pressure could make the dirigible swivel, which would not be suitable for the foundation of the building. Strengthening the building's structure would cost over sixty thousand dollars, a significant sum at the time. The workers also realized that the dirigibles were flammable, and if something were to go wrong, it would cause devastation to such a populated area. These obstacles put an end to the dream of having a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, proving the impracticality of the ambitious plan.
970	15803	6	3	Throughout the excerpt, on trying to build the empire state building; the builders faced a lot of hard attempts trying to build the dock for the dirigibles. One major problem is that the dirigible was not able to land on the building's flat roof. This was stated in paragraph @NUM1 of the excerpt. Another problem is that they had to design elevators and stairs for the passengers to travel to the top of the building to be able to get on the dirigible. Along with designing stairs, they had to be able to build 102 floors just for the area where the blimp would land. This can be supported in paragraph 11 and @NUM2 of the reading. After trying to build the big building, the builders ran into major safety concerns towards the end of the making. The builders did not initially anticipate these issues, particularly concerning the safety of passengers disembarking from the airships high above the city. Ultimately, the ambitious plan to use the Empire State Building as a dirigible dock was abandoned due to these persistent challenges and safety worries.
971	15804	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of these obstacles was that the ""stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" This meant that they would have to spend over @MONEY1 to create a reinforced frame that would be able to stand that amount of pressure. Another obstacle they were facing was that most dirigibles had hydrogen in them, which is very flammable. They were afraid that if the balloon caught on fire, it would fall down to the densely populated city below, posing a significant safety risk to the city's inhabitants. And there was nothing that they could do to change this highly dangerous aspect of the dirigibles. A third obstacle they were facing was that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This meant that the dirigible be constantly moving around while passengers tried to get on and off, which would not be safe for those boarding or disembarking. These are some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced, ultimately leading them to abandon the impractical dirigible docking plan."
972	15805	6	3	"The builders' expectations were set too high and they faced many obstacles they had not foreseen. Safety was a big issue in allowing dirigibles to dock there, especially considering the potential for disaster. The dirigibles ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flamable."" With a highly populated city like New York, it would have been easy for a fire to begin and spread rapidly. Another obstacle of allowing dirigibles to dock was nature's unpredictable forces. The wind at times could be too powerful and dangerous for the massive airships. As said the reading, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These threatening winds would have made it impossible for the dirigibles to land and serve as safe transportation for passengers. The last obstacle was that it was illegal; there had been a law against it. The reading states, ""this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" With this combination of safety concerns, natural impediments, and legal restrictions, there was not even a glimpse of hope that this ambitious plan could be successful."
973	15806	6	3	The builders faced many obstacles when trying to make it possible to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building. They could not add an all steel mooring mast on top of the building because it would add too much stress to the frame and foundation of the building, requiring costly and extensive reinforcements. If they were going to add a mooring mast, they needed to modify and strengthen the building's frame, a complex and time-consuming endeavor. The other problem the builders faced was safety. They had to consider the fact that many dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen, which was highly flammable, posing a significant risk. The Building was in a densely populated area in downtown New York City, further amplifying the potential for disaster. The last obstacle the builders faced was nature. The winds on top of the building were very strong and the air currents frequently shifted. This would have made the dirigibles swivel around the mast, creating a hazardous and unpredictable situation for both the airships and the building itself. These combined challenges ultimately proved too difficult to overcome, and the dirigible docking plan was abandoned.
974	15807	6	3	The Empire State Building was facing off with the Chrysler Building that was being constructed. The Chrysler Building had a trick up its sleeve by constructing a 185-foot spire inside the building and then shocking the public by hoisting it into place. This brought it to a height of 1,046 feet, 46 feet taller than the originally announced height of the Empire State Building, and making it soon to be the tallest building. The Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose.
975	15808	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. When a dirigible was docked, it was held by a single cable tether, adding stress to the building's frame. The steel frame of the building from top to bottom would have to be modified and strengthened to address this new situation; more than @MONEY1 was spent for modifications on the building's framework. When the owners of the Empire State Building found out about the Hindenburg disaster and how it was destroyed by fire, they realized how much worse it could have been if it happened right over downtown New York. If there was a docking accident and the dirigible was filled with hydrogen, then that would be bad for the workers and anyone else around the building, making the docking idea ultimately impractical and dangerous.
976	15809	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that most dirigibles outside the U.S. used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. With downtown New York being a densely populated area, that wouldn't be such a great idea, considering the potential for disaster. Another obstacle they had to face was the weather itself. The Empire State Building was very high so it got really windy. The winds on the top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents, making docking maneuvers extremely dangerous. They also weren't thinking about the government when they were building the mooring mast. There was a law stating that airships couldn't fly too low to urban areas. It would be illegal if a ship even tried using the mooring mast, rendering the entire concept impractical and ultimately unworkable.
977	15810	6	3	The architects of the Empire State Building faced the problem of perfectly placing a thousand foot dirigible on top of the Building, which would not have worked out because of the wind and there was no weight in the back that would have kept the dirigible in place, in which now meant that the dirigible would have been swinging back and forth and gave the risk of the dirigible poking a sharp point on the corner of the Empire State Building and exploding, the dirigible above New York City and putting thousands of life at danger. The architects also faced the challenge of getting the machinery that was needed to raise the mooring mast. Another obstacle the architects had to face was getting approval due to safety habits because what had happened to the Hindenburg in Lakehurst, New Jersey, made people question the safety of such an endeavor. Ultimately, these significant safety and logistical challenges rendered the ambitious dirigible mooring plan impractical.
978	15811	6	3	The builders faced many obstacles in building a moor to dock dirigibles. It was unsafe for a dirigible to be so close to the ground, especially in New York, a densely populated area. The air currents from high above made the machine harder to operate near buildings. Another factor that contributed to the danger was that dirigibles are highly flammable due to the hydrogen which made most of them stay afloat then. The risk of fire was a constant worry. Many blimps attempted to dock at the Empire State building, none of which were successful, highlighting the immense challenges involved and ultimately proving the impracticality of the endeavor.
979	15812	6	3	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were structural problems, breaking laws, and keeping the dirigible safe in the air. The structural problems this would have caused was the immense pressure on the building's foundation from being pulled by the heavy dirigibles. The builders were also breaking The Law because there is a law dictating how low an airship can fly over an urban area, and the dirigibles would be flying way too low to adhere to these regulations. The final obstacle for the builders was ensuring the dirigible's safety in the air. This is due to the high winds at that altitude that could cause the airship to swing around dangerously and potentially break off from its mooring. Another significant issue would be the catastrophic consequences if it blew up, as the flaming debris would rain down onto downtown New York City, creating a massive disaster. Ultimately, these challenges proved insurmountable, leading to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan.
980	15813	6	3	"Architects designing the Empire State Building with the intent of docking zeppelins to it at heights of over 1,000 feet no doubt had a lot to go through. According to ""The Mooring Mast"" by the Empire State Building Company, obstacles included adding stress to the buildings frame with a blimp attached, and the design of the mooring mast itself. The article says that ""the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"" in order to make docking safe. The mooring mast was composed mostly of steel. Other problems facing architects was the wind factor, and keeping zeppelins immobile in the ""constantly shifting"" and ""violent air currents"" at 1,250 feet. Safety hazards also came into account, because architects realized that should another accident like the Hindenburg's occur again in New York City, results could be disastrous. As such, the Empire State Building's mooring mast for zeppelins never went into operation."
981	15814	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast,"" various obstacles were faced in the challenge of docking dirigibles atop the Empire State Building's mooring mast. The first challenge the builders faced was that of nature. ""The greatest obstacle ...was nature itself."" The violent winds that high up would cause the dirigible to swing unpredictably, making it unsafe. Another problem arose when the ""Hindenburg"" caught fire in New Jersey. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This flammability posed a significant risk. If a hydrogen-filled dirigible would catch fire while at the Empire State Building, it could be very dangerous for both the building and the pedestrians below. The last obstacle was a law. ""...existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law made it illegal for any aircraft to fly even remotely close to the Empire State Building, creating legal hurdles to overcome. In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast,"" the builders faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building, highlighting the complex challenges involved."
982	15815	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems when constructing the dirigibles dock. One is the winds and the safety of the building and people. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents... using the Empire State Building was neither practical nor safe,"" making docking a dangerous proposition. Another obstacle that the builders faced was that there was a law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. ""This law would make it illegal for the ship to even tie up to the building or even approach the area,"" further complicating the docking process. There was also another problem related to the building's structure and the foundation. The builders made over sixty thousand dollars of modifications to the building structure in order to construct the mast, showing the extent of the structural challenges they had to overcome. These issues ultimately contributed to the impracticality of the mooring mast concept."
983	15816	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was how would they be able to have a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building without ""adding stress to the building framework."" They couldn't just add the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof because ""the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have been transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven thousand feet below."" They had to find a solution, which was to modify and strengthen the steel frame of the Empire State Building, costing over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications to the building's framework. Moreover, rather than constructing a plain mast, ""rather than building a utilitarian mast with any ornamentation, they built a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside,"" making the 101st floor a glassed-in observation area and the 102nd floor an open observation platform. This elaborate design cleverly integrated the mooring mast into the building's aesthetic, addressing both structural and visual considerations. Ultimately, the design was a testament to the ingenuity required to overcome the challenges of mooring dirigibles to such a tall structure."
984	15817	6	3	"Although the plans for the mooring mast were optimistic, there were many obstacles that kept that plan from becoming a reality. The first reason why builders had difficulty allowing dirigibles to dock was because of safety concerns. While helium itself is not flammable, the airships often used flammable materials in their construction. If one were to catch fire, it would be a danger to all of New York City. Secondly, the high winds made it unsafe for the dirigibles. Paragraph @NUM1 states, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around..."". This made passenger transfer and cargo unloading incredibly risky. Lastly, the builders faced the obstacle of pre- existing laws when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast. An existing law stated that aircraft couldn't fly too low over urban areas. These three main obstacles were faced by the builders of the Empire State Building. The mooring mast never became a reality because of these obstacles."
985	15818	6	3	"In the excerpt, some obstacles they faced were that the building was the tallest in the world at 1,250 ft. like it says in paragraph @NUM1. Another problem they encountered was the dirigibles were unsafe. The Hindenburg disaster, an event where a hydrogen filled dirigible had caught fire, occured during construction. What if one of their dirigibles caught fire over New York City? The whole idea of dirigibles was thought of as dangerous and a potential catastrophe waiting to happen. Finally, there were laws saying that no aircraft could be that close to the city. The whole idea of the ""future of travel"" was very unliked and impractical, making the entire endeavor a significant uphill battle."
986	15819	6	3	"The obstacles builders faced were weather, hight of the structure, stability of the structure, and worriying about the highly flamable gases from the dirigible. The weather affected having the dirigible dock there because the winds could whip it around, knocking it into nearby buildings. The structure needs to be stable at it's hight so the dirigible doesn't knock over the Empire State Building. The author Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 states, ""The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation,"" this was nessisary so the dirigible wouldn't knock over the Empire State Building, wiping out a lot of New York. The highly flammable gases would need to be under intense supervision, because if they caught of fire the Empire State Building and pedestrians, and downtown New York would catch of fire. The risk of disaster was simply too great. These reasons are the obstacles they faced and why a mooring mast was never completed and used."
987	15820	6	3	"One of the big problems facing docking dirigibles is the government and the law. It is illegal to have such a low-flying aircraft. It says, ""... an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). Another obstacle would be safety. Dirigibles are FLAMMABLE and could easily injure and kill people if an accident happened. It is too dangerous, ""Most dirigibles... used hydrogen... hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@CAPS2. @NUM2), making any mishap a potentially catastrophic event. Another problem is nature and weather. The winds up there are extremely high and powerful, posing a significant danger to dirigibles, ""... violent air currents... back of the ship would swivel around... high above pedestrians,"" (@CAPS2. @NUM3), creating a risk of loss of control. Therefore, legal, safety, and weather-related concerns pose substantial challenges to the feasibility of docking dirigibles."
988	15821	6	3	"@ORGANIZATION3 writes in her excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to create a dock for dirigibles. In late 1929 Al Smith was confident of the height and use the building would achieve. Those working on the project of the mooring mast consulted with experts from the U.S. Naval Air Station but eventually found the project too much to handle. The mast never fulfilled its intended use due to the numerous issues they faced, the main one of which being nature itself. Docking a dirigible at the high altitude of the building's peak proved practically impossible. The danger of the project to civilians of New York was a flaw as well due to the inability to keep a dirigible controlled in wind and the high flammability of the vehicles. Legally speaking there was another issue concerning a law that would not allow a dirigible to fly at the altitude required to dock. The idea of the mooring mast was an interesting one, and had it been realized dirigibles may have become significantly more popular. However the mooring mast was impractical, and the obstacles it posed overcame the ambition used to design it."
989	15822	6	3	"The Empire State Building was high in the air, (1,250 ft) the problems were is that the building moves while it's in the air, and if you have something that is weighting around the heavy fifty-thousand pounds maybe more than the building might rip off if there is a big windstorm. The dock sounded like a good idea but you would need a winch and you would have to put some big clamps on the building to secure the balloon or dirigible to dock and refuel. In paragraph 2, Mr. Smith of the building's architectural office said ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear."" If Irving ever decides to put a blimp up and make an air station then make new technology. Who know's in the future we could have cars that fly through air, why not have balloons attached to buildings. Therefore, innovative solutions are needed for such ambitious aerial ventures."
990	15823	6	3	They could not put a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, it would add significant stress to the building's frame, potentially exceeding its design limits. Therefore, such a mooring system is structurally unsound.
991	15824	6	3	"The idea of using a mooring mast in order to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building was never a practical one. This is due to the many struggles that were faced when Al Smith's team was attempting to create a mooring mast that would serve the purpose of docking dirigibles. Such obstacles included the pressure a docked dirigible would have on the building itself, the hazards of high winds causing the dirigible to be shaken violently, the chance of the dirigible catching on fire due to the flammability of the hydrogen within it, and the close proximity the dirigible would have to other buildings in the area. The first problem faced during the development of the mooring mast was the stress the heavyweight of the dirigible would put on the building. ""The steel frame of the [building] would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate [the added pressure from the dirigible]."" The dirigible's weight was not the only thing that put stress on the building; wind pressure would also contribute to the strain. The wind made it difficult for creating a mooring mast's structure because it would not only add pressure to the building, but it would also cause the dirigible itself to not be able to stay in one place. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" An accident that could occur would be a fire due to possible flammability. And since the dirigible is so close to people, such as tourists on the building's observation deck, the dirigible catching on fire (if filled with hydrogen instead of helium) could be more disastrous than if it landed in an open field. Lastly, the dirigible is so close to urban areas that it is illegal for such airships to dock or even fly at such proximity. For example, when the Los Angeles tested the docking process to the mooring mast of the Empire State Building, it ""could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" All of these were major obstacles to the building process of the Empire State Building and its mooring mast for docking dirigibles. These are also the reasons why the architects of the Empire State Building came to the conclusion that such a structure would not be practical to construct, ultimately deeming the endeavor an unfeasible concept."
992	15825	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"", by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced very difficult obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the most difficult obstacles was ""nature itself"". There were very strong winds that ""were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The back of the dirigible would move around and around even if it were ""tethered to the mooring mast"". Also, dirigibles usually landed in open landing fields and would be weighted down with lead weights. However, weighting down dirigibles with lead weights at a height of about 1,250 feet in a place as densely populated as New York City would be ""neither practical nor safe"". The sheer height presented logistical nightmares for handling such weights. Lastly, there ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"", meaning the idea of a mooring mast on the Empire State Building was simply unpractical, rendering the ambitious plan ultimately infeasible."
993	15826	6	3	When designing the mooring mast for the Empire State Building there were many challenges architects and builders had to over come. First were the basic problems of any transportation hub, how to move people and baggage around the terminal. Another more complicated problem was how to compensate for the added stress on the building's frame from the dirigible's load and the wind pressure. This problem was solve by @MONEY1 redesign of the Empire State Building frame. Also moored dirigibles would be constantly swinging around due to the violent wind currents at the top of the Empire State Building. Weights could not be used to hold the airship in place because it would be a danger to people on the streets below. The architects could not design a way to hold the dirigible in place. Eventually the idea of a mooring mast for dirigibles at the top of the Empire State Building was scrapped. The intense winds and logistical difficulties proved insurmountable, making the concept impractical.
994	15827	6	3	"Although there were great hopes for the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, many obstacles were faced while trying to reach this dream. One obstacle noticed while designing the mast to dock on, was that the height and weight of a dirigible would greatly add stress to the building's frame. This would then be transmitted to the building's foundation as well. This clearly possessed a problem bigger than the Empire State Building could withstand. Another reason that builders faced an obstruction in the hopes of allowing dirigibles to dock was safety reasons. One of the most apparent problems, was that most dirigibles outside of the United States were fueled by hydrogen gas, opposed to helium gas. This posed a threat, for hydrogen is highly flammable. Putting a densely populated area such as downtown New York at risk consequently came as an obstacle for builders. The nature itself came as one of the last problems for such a dream. Winds that were constantly shifting due to extreme air currents, at the top of the building could easily cause the back of the dirigible to spin around the mooring mast. Again putting thousands of people below the building, was neither practical nor safe."" As quoted by the passage, ""the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was never destined to fulfill its purpose..."", clearly posing many obstacles in allowing to dock dirigibles on such a building, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the ambitious project."
995	15828	6	3	...well, since one obstacle in their expanded use in New York City was the lack of landing area for the dirigibles, Al Smith decided to add a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building to allow these dirigibles to anchor there to get gas for several hours and also service, and to let the passengers on and off there also. The dirigibles were docked by an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship then tied to the mast. But, then the electric winch cable would cause stress to the building frame. The stress of these dirigible's load and the wind pressure would transmit all the way to the building's foundation, meaning the steel frame of the building should be strengthened or modified to accommodate this new situation, ensuring the building's structural integrity during the mooring process.
996	15829	6	3	The builders faced many challenging obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building. The builders first talked about such figures as Al Smith to try to make the Empire State Building the tallest building in the state, so it would be a great forefront for travelers, and they got it up high to 1,250 feet. But now their obstacle was to have a dirigible reach the top point of the Empire State Building. Al Smith wanted for the top of the Empire State Building to be a landing area, where they could go refueling for hours, or service, and to let passengers on or off the dirigible. So that was one of the obstacles that the builders had to face, to make it work and ultimately create a functional mooring mast.
997	15830	6	3	In building the mast and docking to the Empire State Building, the constructors faced major problems. The idea of a dock for dirigibles was a good idea at the time but faced both structural and social problems. Architects stated that over time the dock for the dirigible and climatic change would cause strain on the framework of the building, leading to more reconstruction and economic spending. Another problem the builders faced was the location of the building itself. Newly built dirigibles had hydrogen rather than helium, which led to flammability concerns. The Hindenburg disaster further highlighted these risks, leading the builders to consider what would happen if a similar incident took place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. Docking of dirigibles led to many obstacles, which ultimately led to the project shutting down, as the potential dangers and costs outweighed the benefits. What was thought as the future is now the past, a testament to the unforeseen challenges and changing priorities that can render even the most ambitious visions obsolete.
998	15831	6	3	The Empire State Building faced different stages. They **innovated** to make it be fixed a little bit. Because it was the tallest building at the time and they **utilized** it to make it more famous. Ultimately, these adjustments helped solidify its iconic status.
999	15832	6	3	"Based on the expert, the builders had many obstacles that the builders had to face, from attempting to allow the dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One obstacle the builders had to face was the steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the situation. The builders also had a problem with the wind because ""... the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell. Therefore, the docking idea was eventually abandoned due to a combination of structural challenges and environmental factors."
1000	15833	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock, as they initially wanted to add the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof so dirigibles could dock there. The idea was that dirigibles would be able to use the mooring mast to secure themselves to the top of the building. However, the architects discovered that placing the mooring mast on the building's summit would create significant stress on the structure's foundation, and this added stress made the original plan untenable."
1001	15834	6	3	Architects of the Empire State Building faced a tremendous amount of obstacles when they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. Al Smith, the man who wanted to construct the tallest building, stated on December 11, 1929, that the Empire State would be 1,250 feet tall. It was decided that the building would have a mooring mast at the top for docking airships like the dirigibles. The blimps, however, was very spacey. Some were as long as one thousand feet in length. So a mooring mast sounds fitting. It would allow dirigibles/blimps to anchor there to refuel as well as letting the passengers off and on. Presently, the purpose of the mooring mast was never carried out. Problems that faced it was that most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen instead of helium, which made the venture far too dangerous. Hydrogen is highly flammable and the German dirigible Hindenburg incident caused the Empire State Building's owners to realize how bad it would be if it happened above such a densely populated area like New York. The winds on top of the building is always changing. A dirigible tethered to the mooring mast would have the back of the ship swivel around and around. Weights couldn't be added to weigh down the back because the blimp would be right above people walking on the streets. Another practical reason was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for the blimp to even approach the building. On December 1930, a U.S. Navy dirigible reached the mooring mast. However, it could not get close enough to tie the blimp in place due to forceful winds. The captain couldn't even take his hands off the controls in fear. Ultimately, the impracticality and safety concerns associated with docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building led to the abandonment of the idea, and in the late 1930's, the idea disappeared to be replaced by airplanes.
1002	15835	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles dock there. These obstacles included having to redesign and modify the building structure, the dangers of a dirigible catching fire, the swirling winds, and state law. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof"" (@NUM1) This was because the building was not originally built to have that capability. This meant, in order to do this meant over sixty thousand dollars in modification had to be spent. Another obstacle faced was the natural dangers of a dirigible. Dirigibles have a likely chance of catching fire, as displayed by the Hindenburg disaster. If that same accident were to happen over the densely populated area of New York City it would be a catastrophe. Another obstacle was that the winds up above the building are always swirling rapidly. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back the ship would swiveled around, and around the mooring mast"" (@NUM2) This would just be dangerous to have something that large spinning round and round. The last obstacle faced by builders was that state law forbade aircraft flying as low as the mooring mast. This would make it illegal for the mooring mast to be used. This probably should have been considered from the start. Overall poor planning created very many obstacles for builders in letting dirigibles dock there, ultimately making the entire endeavor impractical and unsafe."
1003	15836	6	3	Architects struggled with obstacles as they were constructing the Empire State Building. A 200 ft. dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, which would add stress to the building's frame. The Architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof. The observation area was to double as the boarding area for dirigible passengers. Once the building had been framed, the roof had to be completed before the framing of the mooring mast could take place. The mast had a skeleton of steel and was clad in stainless steel with glass windows. The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill it's purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed, proving the impracticality of mooring a dirigible to such a tall structure in a bustling urban environment.
1004	15837	6	3	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted the builders had obstacles they had to overcome in building the dock for the dirigibles. The builders had to think about how the mast would work. It said in paragraph nine ""the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the @ORGANIZATION1 flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"". The builders had to modify the building, reinforcing its structure to withstand the immense forces. As it said in paragraph ten ""Rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickle stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself."" This design was not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing, fitting seamlessly with the building's existing architecture. The obstacles the builders overcame allowed them to use the mast effectively, ensuring both structural integrity and visual harmony."
1005	15838	6	3	"The architects of the Empire State building ran into many problems attempting to allow dirigibles to dock their. One of the main causes was nature. Winds/air current was a big risk. ""Fearing that the wind would blow the dirigible on to the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigibles shall..."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This was a problem that no one could fix, no one can controll wind. Another big impact in the bunch of the mooring mast was law. ""The other practical reason why the dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This law would make it impossible to ever make it a full use of transportation. These obstacles architects couldn't overcome, and the original idea for the project was soon forgotten, rendering the mooring mast a largely unused architectural feature, a testament to ambition thwarted by the realities of weather and regulation."
1006	15839	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced some problems allowing the dirigibles to dock there. One of the problems was that they didn't really have landing gear, making ground landings difficult and mid-air docking nearly impossible. Another reason was it was very unsafe. The pilot of the dirigibles would have to land it about @NUM1 feet in the sky and if they messed up they could potentially die, making the entire process incredibly risky. Another reason was that there was a law against airships from flying low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for people to land it up there, creating a legal obstacle. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems when trying to make a dock for dirigibles, ultimately rendering the ambitious plan impractical.
1007	15840	6	3	"There were many obstacles workers face when building the Empire State Building: making the structure of the tallest in the world, making it serve a greater purpose than being just a building and most of all it had to be stable. Designing and building the tallest structure in the world was quite the CHALLENGE for architect Al Smith, his building had to be taller than the 1,046 foot tall Chrysler Building. The Chrysler building was originally only 925 feet and the Empire State building was planned to be 1,000 feet. But when the architect of the Chrysler Building revealed a spire that was to be placed on top, the Chrysler Building's height shot up to 1,046 feet, just 46 feet taller than the Empire State. The competition had begun. When Al Smith was constructing a piece to fit on top of the sky-scraping building, he wanted to be ""more than a spire or dome or pyramid put there to add a desired a few feet"" (paragraph 2), he wanted something that would truly awe people. With the popularity of blimps, or dirigibles, on the rise, Smith decided he would create a docking station for them on top of his building. Although, a great deal of effort and frustration proved the task impossible. The main reason being that there was too much margin for error and that chance did not want to be taken with a crowded city of PEOPLE below. The tip still being added though, put the Empire State Building at 1,250 feet, 204 feet taller then the Chrysler Building. The BIGGEST CHALLENGE that the building seems to face was the elements. The monstrous structure had to withstand very high winds. Most of the building was weather proof, the only problem being the top. It was designed to look almost like a rocketship, with four wings at it's base. Lined with steel, the structure still holds today. Most of the challenges faced by the crew building this magnificent structure seemed impossible, but they created the building they set out to build. And it is still a marvel, showcasing the ingenuity and determination that made its construction possible."
1008	15841	6	3	There were three main OBSTACLES that the builders faced: safety, Nature and THE LAW. The first obstacle that they faced was safety. Many blimps used Hydrogen instead of Helium. While Helium is a SAFE gas, Hydrogen is a DANGEROUS GAS which are combustible. The second obstacle they faced was Nature. The UNPREDICTABLE winds blew the Blimps off target and because they weren't aero dynamic, it was HARD to manever them. The third obstacle was a law that stated that Blimps can't fly too low, so if the other OBSTACLES didn't exist, it would still be illegal. IN conclusion, they Should Have built a PLANE because PLANES are simply better than Blimps.
1009	15842	6	3	Some obstacles the builders faced during the construction of the Empire State Building's mooring mast was that the building was not stable enough to be able to moor an airship. This was due to concerns about the immense weight and forces involved. The builders did not solve this easily by creating a stronger exoskeleton. Another obstacle that they faced was the high-speed winds at that altitude and the logistical nightmare of safely transferring passengers to and from a swaying airship. They never did solve this problem effectively, and so the mooring project was shut down. The obstacles the builders faced proved insurmountable, leading to the abandonment of the airship mooring concept and the project never was finished.
1010	15843	6	3	"In Downtown New York, Al Smith and his builders faced many obstacles in building and docking his dirigible on top of the mooring mast which had come to a failure by the end. The reason he planned to dock in New York because that's where most passengers would be at the location, where Smith would see it would be a success. The dirigibles are made ""with enormous steel-framed balloon with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium"" (paragraph @NUM1), at the time that Smith wasn't thinking, ""hydrogen is highly flammable"" (paragraph @NUM2) as well as the cotton fabric would catch on fire also; it is a dangerous hazard if any incident would have been in a ""densely populated area."" Another obstacle they dealed with was the ""dirigibles could not more at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM3) since it was illegal to dock the dirigibles in low areas, it couldn't happen for Smith, and the sheer size of the dirigible meant it could potentially crash into one of the other buildings. Not only that but ""the mooring mast could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. Fearing that the wind would blow the dirigible onto sharp spires of the building in the area"" (paragraph @NUM3), a realistic possibility given the closely packed skyscrapers of New York. With all these problems that they had faced through; failed; the dirigibles wasn't the future transportation by Al Smith, and ultimately, all of his plans failed."
1011	15844	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacles during their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles was the structure of the building itself. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would therefore have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation, ensuring it could withstand the considerable forces involved.
1012	15845	6	3	"In the excerpt called ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1, there were obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was nature. That is because the wind at the top of the Empire State were changing a lot due to bad weather, making it difficult to keep a massive airship stable. The blimp would be moving around even if it was tied down. The other challenge was safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"". That is not safe because if a blimp caught on fire at the building there are 102 floors that could burn down, creating a catastrophic inferno. Also, because downtown New York is a very densely populated place, a disaster of that scale would have impacted countless lives. That is the obstacles the Empire State building faced in creating a docking area for blimps, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the ambitious mooring mast project."
1013	15846	6	3	"The mooring mast atop the Empire State Building's problems should have been foreseeable before its construction. The workers building it were certainly against the odds during its construction. The top of the Empire State Building was in a constant weather crisis, ""Winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". This meant that a dirigible that would attach to the mooring mast would be swaying in the wind, rendering docking incredibly difficult. On land, dirigibles have lead dead weights that weighted the back so it didn't sway but that just wasn't practical hanging over crowded city streets. Also, the building could not support a dirigible without transferring its energy back down to the foundation. This meant that the entire building had to be reinforced to move the energy. It was also illegal for dirigibles to fly that low over urban areas, and since most blimps were using hydrogen, a highly flammable substance, the safety of the project was questioned. After the Hindenburg disaster, people seemed more reluctant to support such a project and even the owners of the Empire State Building realized how catastrophic an accident over a place like downtown New York could be. Overall, the theory of a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building would remain a theory due to predictable obstacles that made the concept impractical and dangerous."
1014	15847	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. For one, just letting a thousand-foot dirigible land on the top of a building was a huge obstacle. By having the dirigible on the building held on by one cable tether was bad; wind conditions alone posed a significant challenge. So the builders had to work on the steel frame of the building so that the dirigible wouldn't add so much stress to the building. That was a huge obstacle the builders of the Empire State building had to face, showing the immense engineering hurdles involved in the ambitious mooring mast project."
1015	15848	6	3	"The engineers involved in the creation of the Empire State Building were forced to confront reality when an array of obstacles presented themselves during the time in which they were trying to dock dirigibles. The primary problem was the usefulness of this dock creation. Though this idea was innovative, it was not practical, as dirigibles were never destined to be a popular source of transport. The malfunction in the creation of the idea was its focus, aiming for height over function. This is because the goal in this work was not to create a successful dock, but to add footage to the building. If the focus had been different, the outcome may have been more rewarding. Technical problems also arose, rendering the project unsustainable. Based on laws, safety, and practicality it could not function. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen,"" creating an extreme fire hazard in a highly populated place that would transform into a deathtrap. The anchor for the blimp would only secure it at one point allowing the blimp the spin around, dangerously in the wind. Lead weights, the only solution to this, would disrupt pedestrians on the streets below. There was also an ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" making the project completely unpractical from a legal standpoint. Both attempts at reaching the building failed, displaying the reality of the flaws. Winds and other complications were preventative, highlighting the unsuitability of the location. All in all, the builders were destined to be unsuccessful with the plethora of flaws in this project, solidifying its place as an impractical, though ambitious, endeavor."
1016	15849	6	3	Builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One obstacle was finding a way to tether the end of the blimp without it blowing in the wind or putting the people below in danger, especially given the building's height and the unpredictable nature of New York City's weather. Another obstacle was laws against airships flying too low over urban areas, regulations that existed to protect the populace. One final obstacle was the danger of hydrogen dirigibles in general, as hydrogen is highly flammable. These obstacles proved far too many to outweigh the practicality of the mooring mast, and the ambitious plan was eventually abandoned.
1017	15850	6	3	One of the obstacles that they had to face was they had to make it taller because it was supposed to be the tallest building. They also had problems with it, so they had to keep fixing it, which caused delays and increased costs. These challenges underscored the complexity of the project.
1018	15851	6	3	There was one major problem with the dirigibles docking on the Empire State Building. This major problem was that the mooring mast is so high up in the air and downtown New York where The Empire State Building is located is such a crowded area. If something goes wrong it will affect a huge area because New York is such an urban area. It is a good idea but Al Smith did not take all the precautions that he needed to. Because if something does go wrong a lot will go wrong because downtown New York is such a crowded area. That's the main obstacle that the builders had to overcome with letting dirigibles dock on the mooring mast of the Empire State Building, making the safety risks almost insurmountable in such a densely populated locale.
1019	15852	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building had many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The number one obstacle was safety. The builders thought to themselves, How are we going to safely land a dirigible thousands of feet above the ground, while its freely floating in midair? Plus when you attempt this you are above crowded New York streets. If there was ever a malfunction or error while docking then thousands of people may lose their lives. It's much easier landing dirigibles in an open field than in mid-air because you have much more room, you're planting the dirigible on secure ground, and you can weigh it down so it doesn't move around. Yet landing in open fields is dangerous because on May 6, 1937 in Lakehurst, New Jersey the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by a fire. This example shows how that if that were to happen in mid-air over a crowded New York City street or block then many more casualties would have been recorded. These obstacles were real and these are some of the reasons why the idea of landing a dirigible in mid-air slowly went away, because it wasn't the most logical idea. The risk was simply too great, and the potential for disaster far outweighed any perceived benefit.
1020	15853	6	3	The obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building included legal restrictions against flying that low near buildings. They also faced structural problems in reinforcing the building to be able to hold a dirigible. Furthermore, they could not keep the dirigibles from moving due to the wind. They faced safety issues because some dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, which is highly flammable, and they did not want to have a fire over a densely populated area. They certainly did not want what happened to the German dirigible Hindenburg in New Jersey to happen in downtown New York. Ultimately, dirigibles have never docked there and never will because it is unsafe, making the concept impractical and dangerous.
1021	15854	6	3	"The excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2 describes the creation of The Mooring Mast, and its purpose to extending the height of the Empire State Building. Although during the 1930's the concern of the Mooring Mast serving as a docking area for drigibles, also known as today as blimps. After the 85th floor frame was built and the skeleton of the mast of steel and stainless steel glass windows, issues concerning the landing drigibles arose within the public. There were @NUM1 major reasons why the Mooring Mast of the Empire State Building was never really completed. One reason was because of safety, primarily concerning the highly flammable nature of the gas used in some dirigibles. The excerpt explains how dirigibles from outside of U.S used hydrogen instead of helium, a much safer alternative. And, using hydrogen is extremely flammable. They used the example of the German diriglie Hindenburg being destroyed b/c it was on fire in @LOCATION1. Second reason was the problem of wind currents. Winds were extremely violent, making docking a dangerous maneuver. Dirigibles would move and sway alot b/c of the strong winds. And the moving dirigibles being that they were at least @DATE2 ft long dangled high above urban areas which wasn't safe at all for people walking under it. Thirdly was the issue of it being against the law for airships to fly too low over urban areas was also a safety hazard for people. It would be illegal for dirigibles to be tied up on mooring mast above cities filled w/people risking that it might fall onto people, solidifying the impracticality and inherent dangers associated with the Mooring Mast's intended purpose."
1022	15855	6	3	"Based on the excerpt from The Mooring Mast, the builders of the Empire State Building faced quite a few obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, Al Smith, the four-term governor of New York, was determined to create the tallest building in the world; even taller than the Chrysler building being @NUM1 feet tall. He also wanted the building to be aesthetically pleasing, and nothing ordinary. His determination led him to the idea of the mooring mast, which in itself came with additional obstacles. ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"". This meant that the frame would have to be modified and strengthened, adding to the cost and complexity of the project. Other obstacles included the fact that dirigibles were highly flammable, and could have caused a giant chaotic mess if over a densely populated area such as downtown New York. Also, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" meaning that even if the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel everywhere, which was ""neither practical nor safe."" Ultimately, these significant challenges contributed to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan, despite the initial enthusiasm."
1023	15856	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building faced several obstacles while attempting to let dirigibles dock on it. The first obstacle the builders encountered was the dirigible ability to dock on the building due to the building's structure. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the frame"" (@NUM1). The frame of the building had to be modified and strengthened for the project to work, increasing costs. The next problem was the use of hydrogen in dirigibles, which is highly flamable and posed a significant safety risk. Anyone under the dirigible while it was docked could be in danger if the blimp was destroyed by fire, adding to the impracticality. The biggest problem the builders encountered was the violent air currents at that altitude. The back of the dirigibles would constantly swivel around while docked due to the constantly changing winds, making passenger transfer dangerous and difficult. The mooring mast was not a safe idea that could never have worked, proving the entire endeavor to be ultimately infeasible."
1024	15857	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders couldn't just let the dirigible land on top of the Empire State Building. It would put too much pressure on the building. According to paragraph @NUM1 it says ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" It would have cost sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications that had to be made to the framework. Another obstacle they feared was they noticed how much worse it would be if the dirigible caught on fire on top of the Empire State Building. It would destroy part of the population because it would be in downtown New York. In paragraph @NUM2 the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. It says even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using the State building, where they would dangle above pedestrians was not safe. These issues, coupled with the cost of reinforcing the building's frame, ultimately made the dirigible docking plan impractical."
1025	15858	6	3	One of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building was faced with in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the change in structure and extra cost and time in the completion of the building; the building originally was going to have a flat roof, but in order to dock blimps they had to construct a rocket-shaped mooring mast. Another problem the builders faced was the building and their idea of docking dirigibles being approved by experts. The @ORGANIZATION1 had to take tours of the equipment and mooring operations to ensure the feasibility of the project. The safety of the passengers of the dirigible was very important and a huge obstacle for the construction of the Empire State Building, because any mishap could have led to disastrous repercussions. Two floors would be designated to passengers, and these floors would also include waiting rooms for those who would be picked up. Experts had to build a door strong enough to carry people and fight the blimps from swaying in the harsh winds, ensuring a safe transfer between the airship and the building. These structural and safety concerns ultimately proved difficult to overcome, contributing to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan.
1026	15859	6	3	When building the Empire State Building, the builders had to think about the safety of allowing the dirigibles and their passengers dock there. They had to think about the winds at the top of the building. The wind currents change violently at the top of the building, and because they wouldn't be able to weigh the back of the ship down, the dirigible would spin around and around the mooring mast. They also had to think about dirigibles from other countries. These dirigibles used hydrogen, which is more flammable than the helium ships; this added a significant fire risk that needed careful consideration during the design phase. Ultimately, these factors contributed to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan, ensuring the building's safety.
1027	15860	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced some obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Although this sounded like a great idea and seemed possible at first, it was not. The idea of the mooring mast of the @CAPS1 State Building was neither practical nor safe. In paragraph fourteen, Marcia states why this dirigible idea wasn't so safe: ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This made controlling a massive airship incredibly difficult. In the last sentence of paragraph fourteen, the author states another reason the idea wasnt safe nor practical: ""they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street,"" creating a significant risk of falling debris or even the airship itself endangering people below. Therefore, the mooring mast concept was ultimately abandoned due to its inherent dangers and impracticality."
1028	15861	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems in attempting to dock dirigibles on the mast. One major problem was that the original Empire State Building, ""...could not simply drop a mooring mast,"" on the top of the building because the ""...single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation..."" To address this, over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's frame work, strengthening its upper structure. One reason dirigibles were never docked on the mooring mast was due to ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air current."" This made it impossible for dirigibles to even approach the mass without being impaled by other buildings during the docking procedure. There was also, ""...an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This made it illegal to even dock airships on top of the Empire State Building, as it would violate airspace regulations. Dirigibles contain hydrogen which is ""highly flammable."" If the Hindenburg incident had taken place in New York, the accident would have been ""much worse"" due to the densely populated surroundings. These reasons contributed to the builders' problems, and explain why the mooring mast was never used, ultimately rendering the ambitious plan unfeasible and too dangerous to implement."
1029	15862	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building could not build the mooring mast for the dirigibles on top of the building because it is too high and the roof of the Empire State Building was too flat. Building the mooring mast takes a lot of efforts because they have to care about wind pressure and holding cables on top of the building. They designed the @NUM1 floor with glass to make observation area and boarding area for dirigible passengers, however it has a lot of problems the building. At first the helium is flammable so it is too dangerous and the accident can be worse. They think the greatest obstacle to successful use of the mooring mast is nature because winds on top of the building are constantly shifting due to violent air currents, so it can protect from worst accidents but it is still not safe, therefore the plan was ultimately abandoned due to a combination of safety concerns and practicality.
1030	15863	6	3	"Intended uses for buildings often are met with challenges. In the article ""The Mooring @CAPS1"" by @PERSON1, the obstacles faced in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building are discussed. The first obstacle faced is stated in paragraph @NUM1, when to build a dock on top of the building the entire building would have to be inforced. This was an obstacle because it would be at a cost of @MONEY1. Another obstacle faced was the weather. Above the building violent air currents rage. These currents would cause the ship to swivel around and around the mooring. The final obstacle in allowing dirigibles to dock was the law. According to the article, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas... Would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" The cost of reinforcing the building, the unpredictable weather conditions at that height, and restrictive legal constraints ultimately proved to be insurmountable obstacles, preventing the realization of docking blimps to the Empire State building."
1031	15864	6	3	"The workers constructing the Empire State Building faced many problems while building a dockable mooring mast for dirigibles, two of which were that the winds at that height were unpredictable and foriegn dirigibles using hydrogen instead of helium. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to Violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) This quote shows how unsafe it could be for dirigibles to dock up that high. The high winds could cause loosening of the dirigible which could cause it to go flying off, which is unsafe to the pedestrians below. This risk was a serious concern during the planning stages. Also, ""Most dirigibles from out side of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) This shows yet another safety hazard the workers ran into. If something were to go wrong the dirigible could catch ablaze and come plummeting down to a large amount of pedestrians. These two are reasons or problem workers ran in to when deciding whether to not it would be safe or easy for dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast uptop the Empire State Building, and these factors ultimately contributed to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan."
1032	15865	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems when realizing the idea of letting dirigibles dock there. First off hydrogen flammability @CAPS1 is a major concern; many Blimps were filled with Hydrogen which is extremely explosive. Second off the winds at the top of the tower were very strong, making docking terribly difficult if not impossible. Lastly, it was illegal; in New York there was a law forbidding airships @CAPS2 from flying to low, and to dock on the building it would fly in illegal airspace. The main obstecals the builders faced were hydrogen flammability concerns @CAPS1, high winds and the illegality of thier project, ultimately rendering the ambitious dirigible docking plan unfeasible.
1033	15866	6	3	"Based on the excerpt from The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Paragraph @NUM1 states that ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" The architect on the building had to redesign the whole building so that it could accommodate these dirigibles. ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed"" (∂ @NUM2). This is a monumental obstacle because safety and other issues would prohibit the mast from fulfilling its duties. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"" (∂ @NUM3). Heavy winds, pouring rains, and beating heat could all end in disaster for the urban area. These are the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building @ORGANIZATION1 in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, demonstrating how significant challenges ultimately prevented the mooring mast from achieving its intended function."
1034	15867	6	3	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @PERSON1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Nature itself was one of the greatest obstacles they faced. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" creating unpredictable and hazardous conditions for docking. Also, ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields, could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using those at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe,"" posing a significant risk to public safety. Another reason dirigibles could not dock there was because of the law against airships flying too low to urban areas, further complicating the already challenging endeavor. Overall, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, ultimately rendering the mooring mast concept impractical."
1035	15868	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @PERSON1 @CAPS1 the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are in many ways. In my own opinion I think the Empire State Building is familiar to different people but not many knows the purpose to serve a landing spot for dirigibles. For an example ""The greatest reason was one of safety: Most States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" In conclusion that is one way how they faced the obstacles. In another way how the obstacles and builders of the Empire State Building faced to attemting to all dirigibles to dock there is by transportation. In my own opinion transportation allows people to go to one place to another, For an a example ""By the @DATE1's dirigibles were being hailed as the transportation of the future. The quote that I have just stated means that it allows passengers to go places where they want to. In conclusion, those are two examples the describes the obstacles and that allow dirigibles to dock there. The challenges faced were diverse, ranging from safety concerns to logistical considerations in accommodating a new mode of transport. Ultimately, these examples illustrate the ambitious, yet ultimately unrealized, vision of the Empire State Building as a hub for airship travel."
1036	15869	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there included the lack of a suitable landing area. The excerpt states, ""The one obstacle was their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" Another obstacle was the climate, specifically wind pressure. For example, it was noted that ""The stress of the dirigibles load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" Finally, dirigibles from outside of the United States posed a challenge because many German dirigibles used flammable hydrogen instead of helium. The text explains, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" These were the primary obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced when considering accommodating dirigible docking."
1037	15870	6	3	"Based on the article, ""the Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, there are many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. @ORGANIZATION2 states in paragraph @NUM1, ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons have been aparent before it was ever constructed."" One reason was safety. The dirigibles that were made outside of @LOCATION1 contained hydrogen instead of helium; that's problematic because hydrogen is highly flammable, posing a significant risk. Another reason was because of the winds. They constantly change, they are violent air currents, and they moved the dirigible, making docking a dangerous proposition. The other reason and most important reason is because dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building because it's illegal. There is a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, and for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach it was illegal, thereby rendering the entire endeavor impossible from a legal standpoint. There were many obstacles the builders went through, ultimately making the mooring mast an impractical feature."
1038	15871	6	3	Just like in life there are many obstacles. When you're trying to build a new invention that can't be easy. So there were many obstacles when building a docking area for dirigibles on the Empire State building. One obstacle was the wind. People cannot control the wind or anything in the wind. So when it was really windy the back of the dirigibles would swing back and forth, making docking incredibly difficult. When the Navy tried to tie up the dirigibles they couldn't get it close to the mooring mast because the winds were strong and unpredictable. That's one obstacle of building docking areas. Another obstacle is safety. The dirigibles used gas instead of helium, making them very flammable. Also they don't have a lot of control over them, increasing the risk. If the dirigible ever came crashing down it would kill a lot of pedestrians, causing a huge disaster. If the Navy could fix these obstacles then the dirigible would be a good idea, but it would require significant technological advancements. They are hard to fix but probably possible with enough research. The better idea though is to just get rid of them because the risks outweigh the potential benefits.
1039	15872	6	3	The builders faced a lot of obstacles when building the Empire State Building. They had to build it higher than any other building, but make sure it's stable at the same time by using a steel frame for support. They also had to make the top of the building perfectly or else the dirigibles would not be able to land safely. Eventually it was safe enough for the dirigibles to land, and the people could get off and take a tour of the top part of the building, showcasing the stunning views of the city.
1040	15873	6	3	While building the mast for dirigibles to be able to dock there, the architects neglected to see many flaws that were waiting to happen. First off, it was against the law to have aircraft fly that low to the ground within city limits. Most of the dirigibles were mainly composed of hydrogen, which is highly flammable, so having that fly above a heavily populated area would not be too safe, especially considering the risk of sparks from the building's electrical systems. The wind currents at the top of the building were also very strong, therefore the dirigible could be pushed into the side of a building and get punctured by a sharp object, like the building's ornamentation. In conclusion, the entire idea of having dirigibles landing on the Empire State Building was an accident waiting to happen, highlighting a significant oversight in planning and safety considerations.
1041	15874	6	3	The architects of the Empire State Building faced too many challenges when trying to create a dock for dirigibles. First, there was the matter of safety. If a hydrogen zeppelin were to catch fire over New York City, it would be disastrous, potentially engulfing the skyscraper itself. It could start a huge city fire. Also, the wind was capricious up there, and would make it extremely difficult to dock and stay docked, rendering the entire endeavor impractical. The Navy tried to, but was unsuccessful, because the wind did not allow for them to even get close to the mast. Third, there were laws preventing airships from flying too low over cities, which really put an end to the whole idea. The plan was dangerous from the start, albeit a really awesome one, and ultimately proved to be an unrealizable dream.
1042	15875	6	3	Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was eleven hundred feet below. But the greatest obstacle was the wind, which would constantly shift, due to violent air currents. These unpredictable air currents at such a height made securing a massive airship a dangerous proposition. Ultimately, the combination of structural concerns and, especially, the volatile wind conditions proved insurmountable, rendering the dirigible docking plan impractical.
1043	15876	6	3	"From the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @ORGANIZATION1 the builders faced obstacles to allow dirigible to dock on the empire State building. One obstacle that the builders faced is the lack of suitable landing area on the roof. For that reasoning they needed more room to dock the dirigible. Later they had to put a steel needle on top of the empire State building so the balloons could dock up and let people out. Next obstacle that they faced was that outside the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Therefore it was a risk to take to place a dirigible on top of the building if it blown up the building. Another reasoning of an obstacle is that it was against the law for airships flying too low over urban areas for it can tie up and forceful winds will blow it in different directions. For that reasoning the winds could force the balloon to go in different directions and hit other building if the winds are strong. Those are obstacles the builders faced in the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1. These were substantial challenges, especially considering the technology of the time, as docking a massive airship required precise maneuvering. The use of a steel needle, while innovative, only partially addressed the issue of space. The flammability of hydrogen posed a significant safety threat, making the prospect of a disaster very real. Ultimately, these combined difficulties contributed to the abandonment of the mooring mast project, demonstrating the complexities involved in realizing such an ambitious idea."
1044	15877	6	3	"The success of the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was prevented by many obstacles. Safety was one of the greatest reasons because ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen was flammable."" A fire starting in a densely populated city like New York could damage a lot of people. Nature also proved to be an obstacle because ""winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would cause the dirigible to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast"" that was neither practical nor safe. It would also be difficult to control the dirigible once it is tied to the mast because of the violent motion that the dirigible is in. There was also an existing law ""against airships flying too low over urban areas"". This law made it illegal for any dirigible to even get near the mooring mast or tie to it. Considering all of these significant issues, the mooring mast idea was ultimately abandoned, proving impractical for its intended purpose due to safety concerns, natural elements, and legal restrictions."
1045	15878	6	3	Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced were all for nothing. They spent extra money to restructure things but there was no need. Even if they found some way to get the dirigibles to dock, it was already illegal for aircraft to fly that close to cities, rendering their efforts ultimately pointless.
1046	15879	6	3	Though the idea to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building was seriously considered, safety and reality made it an unrealistic feat. In order for the mooring mast to successfully hold a dirigible, over $2 million worth of modifications had to be made to the framework of the building. Still, obstacles got in the way, the greatest being safety. Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen gas rather than helium, which is highly flammable. The owners of the Empire State building realized how bad a dirigible fire would be, and more so if it took place over the densely populated city of New York. Wind also was a serious factor that disassembled the idea. If the dirigible were to be tied to the mast, the back of the ship would swing around, and lead weights were out of the question. Blocks of lead hanging above pedestrians in the streets of New York was neither a practical nor safe idea. An additional obstacle was the existing law that would not allow airships to fly low, or too close to urban areas. Even if it was attempted, ships would have a hard time docking because of forceful winds. These impediments were all stumbled across in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the building, an idea that is no longer considered.
1047	15880	6	3	"Builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there such as safety, weather, and policies. One of most obvious issues was the safety of the docking. Blimps run on hydrogen, which is highly flammable, thus posing a significant risk. If something were to happen while refueling the dirigible, it could potentially cause extreme harm to the densely populated area underneath it. Another stumping factor was the weather at such high altitudes. At 1,250 feet above the ground, the wind is constantly changing directions because of the ""violent air currents"" so high up. Also, it proved to be difficult to tie the blimp because since the winds were so strong, the dirigible could not get close enough to the building to properly moor. One last obstacle that was apparent was the law that was made stating that airships could not fly low over urban areas. This made the mooring dock illegal if used and made captains of the blimps aware that being so low and close to many buildings makes it challenging and dangerous to dock the dirigibles, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the dirigible docking idea."
1048	15881	6	3	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, we are informed of the many obstacles standing in the way of landing a dirigible at the top of the Empire State Building. One obstacle can be found in paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than hellium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" As you can see the use of hydrogen would provide a great hazard to New York City as a dirigible was landing on the top of the building. It is a highly populated spot and could be potentially very dangerous, especially considering the risk of fire. Another example of an obstacle can be seen in paragraph @NUM2. It stated that ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" @CAPS1 to the wind, particularly the unpredictable and strong updrafts that swirled around the building's peak. L¸sted informs us of the terrible hazard of the air currents at the top of the Empire State Building. All in all, many obstacles stood in the way for allowing dirigibles to dock, and in the end that is why it wasn't successful."
1049	15882	6	3	The Empire State Building was meant to be great – the tallest building in the world. Although they did achieve their goal of height, the true purpose of the building was never used. The building was supposed to serve as a holding dock for these new air ships called dirigibles. However, this was not the case, due to various unforeseen issues.  There were reasons that were apparent before it was ever built. One of the greatest obstacles was nature itself. The winds at the top of the building were too strong for the dirigible to be safely secured. The back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast, and trying to weigh it down with bricks was impractical, especially given the building's height. Another problem that was faced was the law that would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area, making the entire concept unfeasible from a legal standpoint. But two ships did try to land, highlighting the initial enthusiasm despite the challenges. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles failed in landing because it was too dangerous, further proving the impracticality of the plan.  In the end, the Empire State Building never served as a station for dirigibles, and the grand vision of aerial docking remained just that, a vision.
1050	15883	6	3	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building faced some obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. These obstacles included the added stress to the building's frame. The excerpt states in paragraph nine ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether would add stress to the building's frame."" This obstacle could cause the whole building structure to collapse which could cause death and a lot of destruction. The weight and pull of the airship, especially in adverse weather, posed a significant threat. Another obstacle included nature. The excerpt states in paragraph fourteen ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These violent air currents could cause the dirigibles to lose control and hit the building and other buildings around it. These unpredictable wind patterns made docking a dangerous proposition. The stress being added to the Empire State building and nature itself were the two main obstacles for the builders, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the dirigible mooring plan."
1051	15884	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building had to face a lot of obstacles to try to get dirigibles to land there. One of those obstacles was making ""changes to existing plans for the building's steel frame."" Another thing was nature; the winds would not let a blimp land there safely. But the greatest reason was safety: ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable,"" making the prospect of mooring to a skyscraper incredibly dangerous, and ultimately leading to the abandonment of the idea."
1052	15885	6	3	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was in paragraph 6, the excerpt says, ""one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" This means that the architects needed to build enough area to land the dirigibles, precisely and carefully. Another obstacle was in paragraph 8, which said, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" This is explaining that the outcome of nature can be predicted, but it cannot be controlled. The amount of ""violent air currents"" can disturb the landing of dirigibles and it is ""neither practical nor safe"" for the dirigibles to dangle high above the pedestrians that are on the street. Unfortunately, Al Smith's plan to able the dirigibles to moor at the Empire State Building was unsuccessful. There was a law stated in paragraph 10, that made ""it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approached the area"". Instead of using the mooring mast, the dirigibles gave way to airplanes."
1053	15886	6	3	"The builders of the dirigibles faced many obstacles trying to allow them to dock. One obstacle was it was illegal for ""airships to fly too low"" over urban areas. It was also illegal for it to ""tie up to the building."" The purpose of the dirigibles was to be able to dock at the mast. If it couldn't fly up to the mast and dock, there was no purpose in the mast or dirigibles. If they were to be able to dock, they would need to be weighted down by lead weights. The problem with the weights was they would dangle above pedestrians. That was ""neither practical nor safe"" for the pedestrians on the street. If the dirigible docked at the top of the building, they would be held by a single cable. All the pressure on the cable would stress out the building's frame. If that were to happen, they would then have to strengthen and modify the building's foundation. Overall, the major obstacle they faced was not thinking through their plan of the dirigible. If they had thought it through, these obstacles could have been prevented, demonstrating a critical flaw in the initial planning and feasibility assessment of the entire dirigible project."
1054	15887	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to dock there. Many foreign dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium to keep afloat. Hydrogen is extremely flammable, as history has shown. On May 6, 1937, the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed in a fire caused by hydrogen in Lakehurst, New Jersey. When the owners of the Empire State Building understood the severity of such an event, they were deterred from pursuing the docking idea. Nature, if anything, was the biggest obstacle of them all. Considering the building's height, the winds on top were constantly shifting due to violent wind currents. The law was also important to consider, as there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This effectively made it illegal for dirigible ships to tie up to the building or even approach the area, sealing the fate of the airship docking project.
1055	15888	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced a lot of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A few of these problems included designing the mast and making sure that it was safe enough for dirigibles to dock on. According to the excerpt, ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" This meant that the builders would have to change the plan of how the building could be built to be able to hold the dirigibles. After they constructed a new layout for the building the conflict of safety came into play. Stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""The greatest reason was one of safety: Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly inflammable."" This presented a significant fire hazard in the heart of New York City. Another big safety issue was ""nature itself."" ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The air currents made it so that they had to tie down the dirigible, but even then it is dangerous because it would be dangling over pedestrians on the street, posing a threat of falling debris or even the airship itself breaking free. The design and safety of the building both were big obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, ultimately proving insurmountable given the technology and risks involved."
1056	15889	6	3	They had to worry about the safety for the people, to keep it still as they docked. How they would manage it and the possible outcomes if something did go wrong.
1057	15890	6	3	"When the builders of the Empire State Building were constructing the mooring mast for the dirigibles, they faced obstacles that could have jeopardized the project. There were two aspects that the builders had to pay extra attention to: structural integrity and design. Since ""the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Building's flat roof,"" the builders had to modify the building's frame, strengthening the upper floors to bear the load and wind resistance of the mast. These modifications cost over @MONEY1. The other aspect that posed an obstacle was design. The architect, John Tauranac, described the plan to make the mast ""more than ornamental,"" and ""more than something as mundane as a water tank."" So, to fulfill the architect's high aspirations, the builders constructed a ""shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from the inside,"" requiring specialized materials and craftsmanship. Despite the obstacles, the builders got the job done, successfully integrating both structural necessity and aesthetic vision into the final design of the Empire State Building."
1058	15891	6	3	"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, there were numerous obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle being that the architects could not have a mooring mast on top of the building because the dirigible would be, ""... held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This would cause the building to have to weak of a frame from the dirigible's load, as well as the wind pressure. Then the stress would be transmitted down to the foundation of the building. As a result, the building's frame was modified, costing ""Over sixty thousand dollars'"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This significant expenditure highlights the structural challenges involved. Another obstacle was designing the mooring mast, so passengers could be brought, ""... down to the eighty-sixth floor, where baggage and ticket areas would be located"" (@CAPS1 @NUM3). In order for this to be completed, builders had to complete the roof. Lastly, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the moor mast was nature itself"" (@CAPS1 @NUM4). When the winds came into action at the top of the building, the dirigible would swivel around the mast. This would cause a safety hazard for pedestrians on the street below. The Mooring Mast, supported many reasons as to the obstacles builders had to face in attempting to allow dirigible to dock at the Empire State Building, ultimately revealing that ambitious vision faced practical limitations."
1059	15892	6	3	"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, by @PERSON1, the author describes many obstacles builders faced, to allow dirigibles to dock. The first problem was the modifications that had to made to the building's framework. ""Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made,"" showing how expensive this product was going to be. A second potential problem was that, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting."" This could cause many different complications. One of which would be how ""the wind would blow the dirigible onto sharp spires,"" a consequence feared by the pilot of Los Angeles. Another problem brought up by the winds shifting, would be the ship spinning, potentially resulting in catastrophe; this made the mooring process incredibly risky. They accommodated for the use with unpractical things, eventually leading to the downfall of the mooring mast. In the end, these initial problems foreshadowed the impracticality and ultimate failure of the mooring mast as a viable solution for dirigible docking."
1060	15893	6	3	"In the excerpt, the builders and architects building the Empire State Building had numerous problems trying to build the mast on the top of the building. One reason was that they built it before even considering the problems it may cause. The biggest problem was safety: ""the hydrogen used in the dirigibles was highly flammable."" Another problem was wind: ""they would never be able to use the mooring mast because of the violent winds shifting at that height."" If the dirigible was ever tied to the building, ""it's back end would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" The dirigibles moored in fields could be held down with lead weights but using those @NUM1 feet above downtown New York would not be safe at all. The final problem was a law against airships flying that low over cities and pedestrians. So, needless to say, it wouldn't work out, and the impracticality of mooring airships to the Empire State Building quickly became apparent."
1061	15894	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced were many. The architects could not simply drop the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building that was only held by a single cable tether. This would add stress to the building's frame, impacting its structural integrity. To be able to handle the dirigible's load, especially during turbulent weather, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened, which was over sixty thousand dollars' worth, a significant cost at the time. Another obstacle was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were always shifting, an unpredictable element that could lead to the back of the ship swiveling around and around the mooring mast, creating a dangerous and unmanageable situation. These challenges ultimately made the dirigible mooring concept impractical.
1062	15895	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle that the architects faced was the stress the cable tether would put onto the building's foundation. In paragraph @NUM1, L¸sted mentions, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" A very expensive problem to fix, considering the existing structure. Another challenge the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock their was the lack of safety. Dirigibles from outside of the United States used Hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, posing an enormous fire hazard. In paragraph @NUM2 L¸sted says, ""The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse [an] accident could [be] if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" The number 1 obstacle builders faced was nature itself. The violent winds on top of the building were constantly shifting, making docking a perilous act. In paragraph @NUM3 L¸sted reasons. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This would be neither practical nor safe for passengers or the airship itself. The obstacles the builders faced were too egregious, so the ambitious idea had quietly disappeared, deemed ultimately unfeasible."
1063	15896	6	3	"""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2 describes many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. The mooring mast of the building was destined to never fulfill its purpose. One example is most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen for lift. The United States mainly used helium, which is not flammable like hydrogen. Luckily, the owners of the Empire State Building understood that there could have been a terrible accident if hydrogen dirigibles were used at the Empire State Building. Another obstacle to the builders was nature; the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting because of the violent air currents. This made it unsafe for the passengers disembarking and the pedestrians down below. Ultimately, these challenges contributed to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan, making the mooring mast a fascinating but ultimately unused feature of the iconic skyscraper."
1064	15897	6	3	"Marcia @CAPS1's article ""The Mooring Mast"" explains the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. Nobody involved realized the building wouldn't be sturdy enough to allow a thousand-foot dirigible to be docked there. This pressure, and the wind pressure, would be ""transmitted to the building's foundation."" The steel frame would also need to be reinforced, costing over sixty thousand dollars. Several other problems arose due to pedestrian safety issues: most foreign dirigibles used highly-flammable hydrogen fuel instead of helium. Everyone involved in the project realized that should the hydrogen cause a fire, the many people living in downtown New York could lose their lives @CAPS2 because the dirigible would be dangling 1,250 feet over crowded @CAPS3 streets, endangering countless pedestrians. @CAPS2 Furthermore, there was a law banning airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" Ultimately, the mooring mast idea was abandoned due to these safety and logistical concerns. Although the Empire State Building never got to fulfill its intended purpose as a dirigible dock, it remains an international landmark in the heart of New York."
1065	15898	6	3	"In their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building the builders ran into obstacles that in the end prevented the whole idea from moving on. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@NUM1 line @NUM2) because of the changing winds atop the building there would be no safe way to moor a, lighter then air, dirigible on top of a high building. The wind also posed another problem because if the captin let go of the controls the dirigible might spear itself atop another pointy sparer, thus leading to the other high buildings to be an obstacle. The Law of the day also became an obstacle ""an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas"" (@NUM3 line 1) the building itself was high up but even at the top it wasn't legal for any airship to moor due to hieght restrictions. These attempts at building a mooring dock atop the Empire State building would have sent to New York spirling up ward to being in the land inovation but the obsticles were to great to surpass."
1066	15899	6	3	"There were some great obstacles for the dirigibles to be able to land and dock on the Empire State Building. At first the idea was great and staggering people's mind, but when the mast was being built the people realized it would not work. The first problem for the dirigble the law for airships to be so low over urban areas which makes it illegal for the ship to even be that close. The second problem was ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents (paragraph @NUM1)"" which means it would be very dangerous for the passengers to be comming on and off board of the dirigible. The last problem is that foreign dirigibles use hydrogen which is flammable, and to put it over a dencely populated area could cause horrific damage. Considering these challenges regarding legal restrictions, dangerous winds, and the flammable nature of hydrogen, it became clear that docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building was simply not feasible, necessitating extensive precautions that ultimately proved insurmountable obstacles."
1067	15900	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced three main challenges while attempting to make the mooring mast accessible to dirigibles. Most foreign dirigibles still used hydrogen; a highly flammable gas. A fire on the streets of New York would be disastrous, especially given the density of the population and buildings. There were also fierce, ever changing wind currents above the building. These winds would make the back of the dirigible ""swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" making docking incredibly difficult and dangerous. Finally, there was a law in place preventing dirigibles from flying too low when over urban areas. This law made it illegal for dirigibles to tether to the building or even approach it legally. Those three factors made the mooring mast ""neither practical nor safe,"" and ultimately led to the abandonment of the original vision for its use."
1068	15901	6	3	"There were many obstacles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One obstacle they faced is the safety of the passengers when the dirigibles would dock and the framework of the building wouldn't collapse. I know this because in between paragraph @NUM1 and @NUM2 the excerpt says, ""'One set of engineers here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement and the government people in Washington are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast.'"" The mast weighs a lot so they're afraid it will put too much pressure on the Empire State Building. The engineers were also afraid of the dirigibles blowing up because the dirigibles use hydrogen, which poses a significant safety risk. Hydrogen is way more flammable than helium. I know this because in between paragraph @NUM3 and @NUM4 it says, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" These were a few of many obstacles the workers faced, highlighting the complexity and inherent dangers in the ambitious plan to integrate airship travel with the iconic skyscraper."
1069	15902	6	3	In this excerpt the Architect/Workers had to face several obstacles while trying to construct a docking area on the Empire State Building for dirigibles. They had to find away for this huge mast not to kill the building frame. The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand foot dirigible moored the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame. They had to find away to make the load less bearing on the building. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. To fix this Architects and Workers must modifie the steel frame because of the new situation. After this was built and done they had to face the facts that this was imposible to do or not allowed. Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. Ultimately, the impracticality and safety concerns, compounded by regulations restricting flights near urban zones, led to the abandonment of the dirigible docking project, marking the end of a bold but ultimately unrealizable vision.
1070	15903	6	3	In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, the builders went through many obstacles. Dirigibles are steel frames balloons, with envelopes or cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium to make them lighter than air. Dirigibles could be maneuvered by the use of propellers and rudders, and passengers could ride in the gondola, under the balloon. A dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. Over one million dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework. Also, there was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building, ultimately rendering the docking plan impractical.
1071	15904	6	3	The obstacles that the builders of The Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were that they had to allow the dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers on or off. The dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mast. The body of the dirigibles could swing in the breeze, and yet passengers could safely get on and off the dirigible by walking down a gangplank to an open observation platform. Overcoming these challenges was essential for the ambitious plan to integrate airship travel with the iconic skyscraper. They had to go through all these obstacles in order to build The Empire State Building.
1072	15905	6	3	"Al Smith, a former governor of New York, led the way in constructing the Empire State building. This building was being constructed to be the tallest building, taller than the Chrysler building which stood at @NUM1 feet tall. In order to make the Empire State building taller than the Chrysler building, Al Smith wanted to add a mooring mast to the top for docking dirigibles. This idea faced many obstacles. First, the passage states that ""The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthen to accommodate this new situation."" This would cost a large amount of money to construct. Also, ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Furthermore, @CAPS1, the passage states the issue that ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The builders realized many problems after the mooring mast was constructed. The builders should have thought of each situation before building the mast which cost a lot of money. Although the mast was no longer used, the Empire State building still stood at the height of @NUM2 feet, the tallest building built. In retrospect, a more thorough feasibility study could have saved considerable expense and effort."
1073	15906	6	3	"Builders of the Empire State Building never achieved their goal. They had failed to predict the potential problems that they would face. First of all, they couldn't proceed to attempt to land the dirigible on the Mooring Mast because it would be dangerous. Indeed, ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used Hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (paragraph @NUM1). They realized the complications it would imply if there were to be an incident like the one in New Jersey involving a hydrogen-filled airship. Also, nature was an obstacle to the project; ""The winds on top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents"" (paragraph @NUM2). Consequently, due to the winds, the back of the dirigible would be swinging around the mooring mast, which would be a huge danger to the streets below. As a final point, dirigibles wouldn't be able to moor at the Empire State Building because there was a pre-existing law concerning how low airships could fly over urban areas, which essentially made the prospect of regular dirigible landings impossible. Therefore, a combination of safety concerns, natural forces, and legal restrictions ultimately prevented the Empire State Building from becoming a successful airship terminal."
1074	15907	6	3	The architects didn't realize how many potential problems the mooring mast would bring until it had failed. The greatest reason why the dirigibles couldn't land was purely safety complications. Many dirigibles at the time used hydrogen rather than helium, which is highly flammable and posed a significant risk of explosion. Another main reason was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were very violent and could easily push a dirigible in the wrong direction, making docking incredibly dangerous. Before these problems even arose, there was an already existing law against the flying of airships too low over urban areas, further complicating matters. Dirigibles could not dock at the Empire State building because it was unsafe and illegal, rendering the mooring mast project ultimately impractical.
1075	15908	6	3	"In the excerpt the builders of the Empire State Building had many obstacles to deal with. They had to make sure the dirigibles could go high enough and be safe for passengers to board and get off safely. The builders had to deal with a lot. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of @ORGANIZATION1 roof."" Because of the building's height they were unable to make things work. The dirigible was too much and it added stress to the building's frame; to unload things it was too difficult, the floor it needed to be on was too low. ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear."" The project was so difficult that they had to quit the task and expand at another time. The workers were devastated by the unworkable logistics of the dirigible project, forcing them to abandon a key element of the original plan."
1076	15909	6	3	"There were many problems to overcome in the construction of the mooring mast on the Empire State Building. The first problem to overcome was the stress a thousand foot long dirigible would add to the building's frame. This was solved by spending over $2 million in modifying the building's frame work. Another problem was a law against airships flying too low around urban environments, brought up in paragraph 2. As the author, @CAPS1, notes, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" He is writing about the wind. At 1,250 feet high the wind is violent, and would swing a dirigible around too much to be safe, and ends could not be weighed down for fear of injuring a pedestrian. Those were three significant reasons the mooring mast failed, ultimately rendering the ambitious project impractical."
1077	15910	6	3	In attempting to let dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building the builders faced many problems. The first problem was the fact that most dirigibles from outside of the U.S. used hydrogen instead of helium. The problem with hydrogen is that it is highly flamable and would be a huge risk to have a hydrogen dirigible over a city full of pedestrians because it could catch on fire and hurt them. Secondly, the winds at the height of the Empire State Building were always shifting which presented great risk to pilots. If their dirigible got blown off course it could collide with other tall buildings in the city. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles got blown off course by the strong winds and the pilot could not take his hands off the controls in fear of hitting other buildings. Lastly, there was a pre-existing law that would have made it illegal for a dirigible to have entered the airspace around the Empire State Building. These significant challenges ultimately made the dirigible docking plan impractical and unsafe.
1078	15911	6	3	It feels like a very hard test for them because they're trying to make an age of transportation echo the thoughts of the pioneers. But once the architects designed the mooring mast and made changes for the building skeleton to accommodate it, they framed the 85th floor; however, the roof had to be completed before the framing could fully progress upward. This intricate process highlights the challenges faced when blending innovative design with practical construction, ensuring both structural integrity and symbolic representation.
1079	15912	6	3	During 1929 when Al Smith announced that he was going to make a docking port for blimps at the top of the Empire State Building there were many obstacles in the way of the architects building design. Building a dock for blimps at the top of the world's tallest building is no easy task, and the sheer height presented logistical challenges. They should have realized previous to the project that this was a lost cause, but they tried it anyways. The architects on the project had to devise a plan that would strengthen the main support beams of the building while still being able to control the movements of the back of the dirigibles due to uncontrollable wind conditions. Unfortunately they never found a way to successfully complete this task, primarily due to the unpredictable and powerful wind currents at that altitude, and because of that the Empire State Building could never dock blimps.
1080	15913	6	3	In the 1930's this would have been a difficult obstacle to face. The idea altogether was doubted by many People. the first airship, @CAPS1, was comparing in height with the chrysler building. And the mooring mast would have worked in theory, but in reality had too many Problems, including swaying in high winds and difficulty in securing the massive airships. It was a potentially dangerous attempt, fraught with technical challenges and public skepticism, ultimately proving unsustainable.
1081	15914	6	3	When the Empire State Building was constructed, ambitious plans included a mooring mast for dirigibles. However, these plans ran into many problems. One significant issue was that most overseas blimps at the time were still filled with hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. Constructors understandably wanted to avoid recreating a Hindenburg-like disaster over a densely populated area like New York City. Ultimately, the greatest obstacle to the mooring mast was nature itself. The wind currents at the building's summit proved violent and unpredictable, constantly shifting direction. Attempting to dock a dirigible in those conditions would have caused it to swivel dangerously around the building, creating an unsafe situation for passengers. Therefore, the mooring mast never fulfilled its intended purpose, proving impractical due to safety concerns and the unmanageable force of the wind.
1082	15915	6	3	The building of the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building was very poorly thought out, explaining the many obstacles faced. From the very start, Al Smith seemingly disregarded public safety. The potential use of flammable hydrogen, unlike helium used in other countries, posed a significant risk. While a hydrogen-related incident in New Jersey would be bad, in densely populated New York City, it would be catastrophic. The idea of lead weights securing the airships was also alarming. Imagining walking down the street with the risk of a lead weight falling was a valid concern. Violent air currents in New York would cause tied-up dirigibles to sway, making lead weights impractical and unsafe. Crucially, legal considerations were overlooked. Laws prohibited airships from flying low over urban areas or mooring to buildings. In conclusion, thorough consideration of safety and legality should have preceded the hype surrounding this impractical and dangerous endeavor.
1083	15916	6	3	"By reading the passage ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted it is easy to see the many complications with landing a dirigible on top of a 1,250 ft. building. For one there is the natural effect of wind. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These winds would make it difficult to land any floating aircraft anywhere if the back wasn't able to be weighted down. Another obstacle the builders faced was that the frame had to be strong enough to hold a 700 ft. long dirigible. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" The worker's then had to spend over $500,000 to remodel the framework of the Empire State Building. Another issue is that anchoring the blimps would be illegal, because of ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" All these safety troubles and violations would all together make the ""mooring"" an impossible feat."
1084	15917	6	3	The architects and builders faced large problems in the construction of the docking platform, even though they had not noticed them at first. The builders did not notice any large problem until after the dirigible Hindenburg crashed in Lakehurst, creating worries about hydrogen's flammability. The building's owners became greatly concerned for the safety of the people inside and below the building if a blimp fell into the same situation as the Hindenburg, leading to a re-evaluation of safety protocols and potential design modifications.
1085	15918	6	3	"When Al Smith first came up with the plan to use the Empire State Building is a mooring mast, he had no idea how obstacles they would face in a attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One large obstacle was safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) The reason this is so unsafe is because if the gas inside ever happened to catch on fire, the entire craft would exploded in flames, endangering all aboard. This is a hazard to those in the ship, as well as those in the streets below. Another obstacle was the high winds at the top of the building. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) This was a problem because it would cause to the dirigible to move all over the place, making docking incredibly difficult and dangerous. The idea of using lead weights to weigh it down was proposed, but they would be a danger to pedestrians below. A third and final obstacle they faced was the stress a dirigible would cause on the building's frame. The building's design was not capable of handling the stress of a dirigible tied to its mast, without changing the design, the dirigible would probable tear the building apart. The only solution was to strengthen the building ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework,"" (@CAPS1 @NUM3). That is a ridiculous amount of money they had to spend just to make it possible for the dirigible to dock. It is easy to see how difficult the project was based on the many obstacles the builders had to face."
1086	15919	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced not so many but difficult obstacles. One of the obstacles were the crowded spaces they had for the dirigible. Crowded spaces can cause the dirigible to hit or bump into another building if not pop the thing. The wind could also make the dirigible sway and hit another building. Another obstacle was the stress the building was having because the dirigible was tied to it. If the wind blew hard, the dirigible would put a lot of tension on the building, potentially compromising its structural integrity. These challenges ultimately contributed to the abandonment of the dirigible mooring concept, highlighting the practical difficulties of integrating such technology with skyscraper design.
1087	15920	6	3	While attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. The first obstacle they dealt with was the fact that mooring such heavy blimps would add stress to the building. In fact, 'the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation,' posing significant engineering challenges. Another obstacle they endured was the fact that the hydrogen gas used in the dirigible was very flammable. As bad as the Hindenburg explosion was, it could have been much worse, 'if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York,' creating a catastrophic scenario. It was also very dangerous that the blimps would fly so low over an urban area, increasing the risk of accidents. Lastly, the strong winds would making mooring difficult. Winds that high up on a building are, 'constantly shifting due to violent air currents,' making the docking process treacherous and unreliable. The workers clearly had many problems in building the mast and given the insurmountable difficulties, the ambitious plan just couldn't be completed.
1088	15921	6	3	"There were multiple obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles the builders faced was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or ever approach the area. Another obstacle the builders faced was forceful winds. ""The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached The mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" The greatest obstacle was the winds on top of the building, which were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents. The back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. The last obstacle was the dirigible wasn't safe to have dangling high above pedestrians, thus ultimately rendering the mooring mast concept impractical and unsafe."
1089	15922	6	3	"In the excert The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION1, The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example One big problem they faced was the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state building's flat roof. This operation would not be possible because ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings foundation, wich is nearly 11 hundred feet below."" the steel frame of the empire state building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new sittoation. One big obstacle they faced was a big Safety problem. ""Most dirigibles from outside the @CAPS1 used @CAPS2 drogen rather than @CAPS3 lium, and @CAPS2 drogen is very flammable, posing a great risk to the structure and the city below."" the biggest obstacle to face was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights but using them at the empire state building, were they would be hanging on top of padestrans on the street was neither practical nor safe. These are the obstacles the empire stat building faced."
1090	15923	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some obstacles were the lack of a suitable landing area, as the surrounding city streets offered no space. Another obstacle was they could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof, a thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. Also if they wanted to do this, the massive forces would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below, requiring significant structural reinforcement. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making docking dangerous. To reduce this, dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down with lead weights, but the obstacle to this is having weights dangling high above pedestrians was neither practical nor safe. All these obstacles, yet these people were still able to build the Empire State building with a mooring mast, ultimately demonstrating their ingenuity despite the impracticality of the airship docking concept.
1091	15924	6	3	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles. As stated in paragraph 1 of the excerpt, the Empire State building was planned to be the tallest building in the world in the @DATE2's. The architect of the Chrysler building constructed the building to be 46 ft taller then the Empire State building. Governor of New York, Al Smith did not want loose the tittle of the tallest building. In paragraph 6 it tells you Smith's idea: A mooring mast was added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers on & off. Safety issues did not allow the mooring mast of the Empire State building to fulfill its person, said in paragraph @NUM1. Most dirigibles from outside the @PERSON2 used hydrogen instead of helium, hydrogen is highly flamable. Because of pointy buildings this was extremely dangerous. As stated in paragraph @NUM2; the greatest obstacle was nature. On top of the Empire State building, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, also, the law to fly too low. In fact, only a few attempts were ever made to moor a dirigible to the mast, and these proved to be quite perilous. By the late 1930's the mooring mast plan disappeared, deemed impractical and unsafe."
1092	15925	6	3	Builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, there was the problem of having a large dirigible moored to the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, which would add stress to the frame of the building, all the way to its foundation. To fix this, the frame of the Empire State Building would need to be strengthened to withstand the immense forces. Another problem was the safety of the citizens on the streets below. Dirigibles using hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, could burst into flames, posing a significant risk. Also, high winds would make it hard for the dirigible to tether to the mooring mast. The dirigible could not be weighed down, as any weights would dangle precariously over pedestrians on the streets. The effectiveness of these winds was shown when the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles attempted to dock. During this attempt, the winds were very strong, and the captain of the dirigible feared that it could be punctured by other buildings' sharp spires, further highlighting the dangers. These challenges ultimately proved too difficult to overcome, leading to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan.
1093	15926	6	3	Some obstacles the builders faced were too much stress to the building's frame. It would have to transmit all the weight and pressure all the way to the building's foundation. Also, there would only be one cable holding it in place, increasing the load on that single point. The cable was called a tether. Another obstacle would be an existing law saying that you can't moor your ship there because you are flying too low. In December 1930 the Goodyear dirigible tried parking there but they were afraid of the wind knocking it into another building. Therefore, they went through a few hard obstacles, but in the end, they fixed it and made it happen, overcoming these challenges to achieve their goal.
1094	15927	6	3	"Dirigibles, modernly called blimps, were widely regarded in the 1920s as the latest and greatest form of transportation. These dirigibles needed quick means of refueling and unloading passengers both efficiently and with safety. At the very time these dirigibles became popular, modern day skyscrapers such as the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building were dominating the skyline in New York City. Al Smith, a former governor of New York who was heading efforts to construct the Empire State Building, came up with the idea of building a mooring mast on the top of his building which would help dirigibles dock, refuel, and unload cargo quickly and efficiently. Although, at the time this idea was thought of as both ""practical"" and ""workable,"" it was never put to use because of safety concerns found later by Architects. These safety concerns included fear of the ""constantly shifting"" winds ""due to violent air currents"" as well as air space restricting laws that prohibited ""airships from flying too low over urban areas."" Ultimately, these challenges prevented the Empire State Building from becoming a functional airship terminal, proving that even revolutionary ideas can face insurmountable obstacles."
1095	15928	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were extreme to overcome. One obstacle for the builders was trying to make it so the building itself could handle the stress of the dirigibles tied to the building, with wind pulling at it and swaying back and forth as wind direction changes. Also, its height was too low for dirigibles to be safely flying because of the other buildings surrounding it. The most important factor was that the gases inside the dirigible were flammable and a leak would be devastating to the people below in New York City. These challenges ultimately proved insurmountable, making the dirigible docking plan impractical and unsafe.
1096	15929	6	3	Diregible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937. The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. In The MOORING MAST, Dirigibles had a top speed of eighty miles per hour, and they could cruise at seventy miles per hour for thousands of miles without needing refueling; some were as long as four blocks in New York City. The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area, revealing a significant safety and logistical concern for the future of airship travel in urban environments.
1097	15930	6	3	"In the 1920s Al Smith hoped to build the world's largest dirigible dock in New York. However, during construction, the Empire State Building's mooring system ran into many problems. One obstacle was the harsh winds high above New York. In paragraph @NUM1, the author says, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These winds caused the dirigibles' tail end to move around while docked, causing unsafe landings and take-offs. Another obstacle faced was a law that prohibited airships from flying low over urban areas, effectively hindering access. This was feared because of the Hindenburg crash in 1937. The building officials feared if that crash were to happen in New York then the damage would have been catastrophic. The final obstacle faced by the Empire State Building's mooring system was that many blimps from overseas used hydrogen instead of helium to fly. Hydrogen is extremely flammable, and had a crash occurred over New York, the damage would have devastated the city and would have caused a tremendous amount of casualties. Thus, these significant safety concerns and logistical challenges ultimately led to the abandonment of the dirigible dock concept."
1098	15931	6	3	"Based on ""The Mooring Mast"" written by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Constructed in the 1930s the Empire State Building was originally built to exceed the height of the Chrysler Building; it was going to stand at a whopping 1,250 feet tall. What added to this building's height was its great mooring mast that stood atop the building. Dirigibles, very similar to balloons, were gaining popularity in the aviation world. However, there were many issues that held back the progress of this project, ultimately dooming it. Most of these issues were safety problems, making the endeavor too risky. One practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was because of an existing law against airships flying too low to urban areas, a regulation designed to protect the city's inhabitants. Another reason was the flammibility of these ships. Most of them ran on hydrogen rather than helium; helium was safer but more expensive. Hydrogen is very flammable and if the ship exploded many civilians and passengers would be killed. In summation, because of safety risks and logistical challenges, the mast of the Empire State Building could and was never used for its original purpose, rendering the ambitious plan impractical from the start."
1099	15932	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles. ""... the lack of suitable landing area."" (@CAPS1 6). This means it was difficult to land the Dirigibles. Another problem they faced was nature. The wind and weather could make landing the dirigibles very dangerous. ""Dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which called in a line from the front of the ship, and tied it to the mast."" (@CAPS1 6). So, if the weather was too windy, it made it difficult to land. This means if the wind blows in the wrong direction, or competes with the electric winch, it would be difficult and dangerous to land the dirigible. Another obstacle was the expenses. ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This means they had to pay a lot of money, which is not easy. Paying for the framework was an obstacle they had to face. Therefore, the builders had to overcome issues with landing space, weather conditions, and financial costs."
1100	15933	6	3	The builders of the dirigible ports in New York thought that they had a great idea and that they were pioneers. They soon realized that there were some problems with their ideas. One major problem was safety. As noted in paragraph two, most European dirigibles used hydrogen, which was highly flammable. New York is one of the biggest cities in the United States, and it was far too densely populated to take that risk. Another problem was wind. At those heights, the wind currents were unpredictable and winds reached high speed. If the dirigible were to be blown around while in the downtown area and were to hit a spire of the building, there would certainly be quite a few casualties. After the risks and rewards were balanced, they realized it just wasn't worth it.
1101	15934	6	3	The obstacles that the architects of the Empire State Building faced were harsh. They had to figure out how they were going to get the dirigibles to land on the mooring mast, a task proving more complex than initially imagined. Another problem was that the government was getting impatient with the delays and cost overruns. What made things worse was Al Smith, the former governor and driving force behind the project, was being sneaky and untruthful. He lied about how high the actual height is. He lied about how he would fix the problems there were with the mooring mast, promising solutions that never materialized. They were also afraid that a dirigible would blow up on the mooring mast like the Hindenburg. So they just put it aside and made over time the world's highest soda fountain and tea garden for the use by the sightseers, ultimately repurposing the space to generate revenue and attract visitors.
1102	15935	6	3	One problem that the builders had was that they had to make the mast big enough. Some dirigibles would be @NUM1 feet long. If they just dropped a mast on top of the Empire State Building because of the stress of a thousand-foot dirigible held to the Empire State Building by just one cable tether, there would be a lot of stress put on the building's frame. If they did add the weight of the dirigible and the wind, all of that stress and pressure would be put on the building's foundation that was nearly eleven hundred feet below, which was not safe at all. They had to go through all of the different possibilities, and they also had to make sure that it was going to be safe. While designing the mast, they had to consider the winds at the top of the building; the winds were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents. If they did not design a good mast, the dirigible would be dangling above pedestrians, which was not safe, making it a complex engineering challenge to balance safety and functionality.
1103	15936	6	3	"There were three main obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced when they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast. The first obstacle was ""nature itself"", meaning that the air currents at the top of the Empire State building were so powerful that the wind was constantly changing directions. This meant that if a dirigible could somehow fly through the winds and could be tied to the mast it would ""swivel around and around"" and would end up ""dangling over pedestrians"" which ""was neither practical nor safe."" As a result of the unpredictable winds, even experienced pilots would have struggled to maintain control of the massive airships. A dirigible is not leagally allowed to dock at the mooring mast because it would be ""flying too low over urban areas"" which there is an ""existing law"" against. This is a problem for the builders because no matter how hard they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock, they would not be leagally allowed to dock dirigibles at the Mooring Mast. Existing regulations simply prohibited the low-altitude flight necessary for docking. Lastly, many dirigibles used hydrogen gas as a feul. Hydrogen gas is ""highly flammable"" and a dirigible using hydrogen gas is therefore also highly flammable and could potentially pose a disaster to the ""densely populated area such as downtown New York."" The risk of a hydrogen explosion over Manhattan was simply too great. Because of potential fires, city laws, and air currents, the builders of the Empire State Building were faced with significant and ultimately insurmountable obstacles when they tried to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast."
1104	15937	6	3	"""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION3 details the challenges faced by the Empire State Building's builders in their attempt to accommodate dirigibles, or blimps. A significant hurdle was safety. Marcia Amidon L¸sted notes, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This posed an unacceptable risk over densely populated New York City. Nature itself presented another obstacle. Paragraph @NUM1 states, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These unpredictable winds would cause a docked dirigible to swing uncontrollably around the mooring mast. Furthermore, paragraph @NUM2 mentions, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" making docking, or even approaching the building, illegal. The builders also faced the increasing prominence of airplanes, which overshadowed dirigibles as the primary mode of air transport. Despite the builders' efforts to make the Empire State Building a national @CAPS1, the overlooked issues with the mooring mast prevented it from achieving its intended purpose."
1105	15938	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" written by Marcia Amidon l¸sted she explained the challenges dirigibles faced when trying to dock to the Empire State Building. The engineers had to take into account the obstacles of the make up of dirigibles, the building structure and weather conditions when attempting to create a landing area for dirigibles. A mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building could never be functional. Dirigibles must be lighter than air to fly. Gases such as helium and hydrogen are used to make blimps less dense. Being highly flamable, hydrogen could easily create a massive fire. The owners of the Empire State Building, decided if the blimp ever caught on fire it would be a much larger disaster over an area with a large population. Another factor that halted the docking of dirigibles was the building structure. The docking of a dirigible adds extra stress to the Empire State Building. The engineers were forced to design the framework of the building so it was strong enough to not collapse under the extra pressure. This took time and ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications hat to be made to the buildings frame work"". Lastly weather conditions tested the engineers, on the top of the Empire State Buildings the winds are quite unpredictabled. They often shift because of ""violent air current"". No matter how the builder tie the dirigible to the mast the blimp will be unsafe. Due to winds, and structure of the building as well as blimp, the engineers couldn't create a docking area for dirigibles on the Empire State Building."
1106	15939	6	3	Work faced many problems with building docks for dirigibles to land on docks attached to the Empire State building. In paragraph @NUM1 it states that dirigibles disappeared and did not become the transportation of the future. The Empire State building never got to fulfill its purposes for dirigibles. The envisioned rooftop mooring mast, intended to usher in a new era of airship travel, ultimately became a largely unused feature of the iconic skyscraper. Thus, the grand plans for lighter-than-air passenger service directly to the heart of New York City never materialized.
1107	15940	6	3	When Al Smith first had his idea to build a mast on which to dock dirigibles, it started out as friendly competition. However, nobody predicted the obstacles that would be encountered while trying to execute the plan. One of these obstacles was simply that it was unsafe. Dirigibles used hydrogen, which is very flammable. If there was an accident the results would be devastating in places populated as New York City, given the potential for fire. Another obstacle was the wind. The wind currents at the top of the building shifted constantly, making the dirigible swing from side to side, which was dangerous for passengers attempting to disembark. One more obstacle was the fact that there was a law that prohibited airships from flying below a certain height in cities, thus presenting legal hurdles. Clearly, many obstacles were encountered, and the mast never ended up serving its intended purpose, proving the impracticality of the original design.
1108	15941	6	3	Based on the excerpt, obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was that the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the mooring mast. Furthermore, rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architect designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself, complicating the construction. These design choices, while aesthetically pleasing, added to the complexity and challenges of making the dirigible mooring a reality.
1109	15942	6	3	"Based on the @CAPS1 ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1, The builders of the Empire State building faced many obsticals in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Many obsticals came forth with building the Empire State building with Al Smith constructing the whole building. With Al Smith constructing the whole building, he was determined to outstrip the height. Al Smith secretly constructed a 185 foot spire inside the building, that shocked the media and public by hoisting it up to the top of the Chrysler building. Another obstical that was faced during the building of the Empire State building was the idea of having dirigibles being able to dock at the very top of the building. The idea of having the dirigibles being docked at the top of the Empire State building, the dirigibles would only be held by a single cable tether, which would add tremendous amounts of stress to the building's frame. The greatest obstical that came to building the Empire State building with the idea of docking dirigibles at the top was safety. Most dirigibles from outside the U. S. used hydrogen rather than helium, & hydrogen is very flammable and if anything were to happen it could destroy New York. These are the reasons why the builders of the Empire State building faced many obsticals in the @CAPS1 ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1. These obstacles ultimately proved insurmountable, rendering the mooring mast concept impractical."
1110	15943	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several challenges in the completion of the landing dock for dirigibles. The first problem was the frame of the building. The original frame was not strong enough to support the substantial weight and potential strain of the dirigibles when docked, so they had to reinforce the steel framework considerably to withstand the forces the airships would present. The next problem was the lack of a suitable, stable landing area atop the skyscraper. They decided to put an anchor, a mooring mast, on the top of the building to secure the dirigibles when docked. However, the violent winds at the top of the building created dangerous conditions, making it nearly impossible for the pilot of the dirigible to get close enough to the anchor, because of fear that the airship might be swept into a nearby building. Another reason why the dirigibles could not be docked on the top of the Empire State Building is because of a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, further complicating the logistical and legal aspects of the endeavor. A couple of attempts have been made, but to this day nobody has successfully docked a dirigible on top of the Empire State Building, rendering the intended airship docking station ultimately unusable.
1111	15944	6	3	"The Empire State Building is known for its great size & distinctive shape in New York City's skyline, but what most people probably do not know is that the tower on top is actually a mooring mast for dirigibles. This is probably a little known fact because it could never actually be used to dock blimps for numerous reasons: safety, nature, & the law. The mast would have revolutionized travel in New York if international dirigibles could stop there after long Transatlantic flights, however, because of the gas used by foreign blimps, safety would have been a huge issue. In paragraph 1, the author states, ""most dirigibles from outside the U.S used hydrogen rather than helium, & hydrogen is highly flammable."" There was even an accident with the German Hindenburg, & if a blimp caught fire over densely populated city streets this would be an even greater problem of safety. Nature was also a matter of safety that needed to be considered. At such a great height there are strong, unpredictable winds, & ""even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around & around the mooring mast"" (paragraph 2). There were no means of anchoring the back of the blimp because heavy weights such as those which would be used in open field landings would pose a serious threat hanging off the back of a blimp from over 1,000 feet with pedestrians below. There was simply no practical way to combat the nature that prevented the possibility of blimp stocking. Finally, it would have been illegal for a dirigible to dock at the mooring mass on the Empire State building. It was against the law for ""airships flying too low over urban areas"" (∂ 4). The law ended up being the final obstacle that could not be overcome, so the Empire State Building never became a docking post for blimps, but it is still an incredible architectural feat."
1112	15945	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One was that they had to add over sixty thousand dollars' worth of changes to the building's framework because docking dirigibles on the building would put a lot of stress on the framework and foundation. Another problem was that most dirigibles outside the U.S. used hydrogen, which was highly flammable, and an accident at this building would be very dangerous because it was in such a densely populated area. Nature was said to be the biggest obstacle: ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (line @NUM1) This would cause the dirigible to sway back and forth uncontrollably, endangering pedestrians below and passengers on the dirigible. Lastly, a law was in place against airships flying too low in urban areas, further complicating matters. All of these obstacles ultimately made docking a dirigible there impossible, rendering the ambitious plan impractical."
1113	15946	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" the builders found many obstacles on the way to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the empire state building Some of those obstacles were as follow. The main concern was the safety of the passenger boarding and unboarding as well as the people below. The concern for the people below was how the dirigible sometimes was floating with hydrogen instead of helium, since hydrogen is highly flammable. So they didn't want chances of the dirigible blowing up near the city. Another main concern was there was an ""exsiting law over airships flying to low over urban areas"" (par @NUM1). The dirigible floated with the air and being as long as @NUM2 ft. the back of the dirigible where it wasn't securely fastened would circle around the mooring from the high wind currents. The shifting winds posed a significant safety risk. Another obstacle to the dirigible docking plan was, allegedly, driven by jealousy; the man behind the project was supposedly envious of his competition, Al Smith, and his rising prominence, and pushed the dirigible idea forward in part to regain ground, demonstrating that personal rivalries played a role in the pursuit of this ambitious, albeit ultimately impractical, endeavor."
1114	15947	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. They ultimately abandoned the plan because the dirigibles ""Could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1 lines @NUM2), meaning it wasn't safe to proceed with the docking plan. The strong winds surrounding the building made it impossible for the airships to safely approach and secure themselves, thus rendering the entire concept impractical and dangerous."
1115	15948	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @PERSON1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles they faced was figuring a practical and safe way to dock the dirigibles. Practicity and safety were an obstacle because the builders of the Empire State building were the first to attempt a docking dirigibles on air, @CAPS1 thus they had no past trials to refer to. In this project practicity and safety worked together. For example ""..engineers [had] to dope out a practical, workable arrangement..."" @CAPS1 so that the airships could be moored to the mast easily and secure. This would assure the passengers safety as well as stability to the building. The second obstacle the builders faced was distributing the stress added to the building as the dirigible docked. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" @CAPS2 transmitting all of this stress to the foundation was a challenge because the foundation ""... was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" Another challenge that arose was that, to accommodate this situation ""the steelframe [of the building had] to be modified and strengthened..."" The modification to the buildings framework was worth ""over sixty thousand dollars..."" As such, the builders had to re-engineer parts of the building. In conclucion, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles and attempting to dock dirigibles in their building; these obstacles ranged from ensuring the safety of the passengers, to redistributing the building's framework to accommodate the dirigibles."
1116	15949	6	3	"Al Smith and other workers are working on Empire State Building. They been having a few obstales with the project like they can't have it has high as they wanted it. They had to fix the mast skeleton if they wanted to do more. The Dirigibles for example. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen than helium, and hydrogen is highly  flammable. When the german dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937. This explains they had gotten a law after this from happening so they can't have things near the Urban areas. This proves that there were limitations with Empire State building that they worked around."
1117	15950	6	3	The obstacles that were faced by the Empire State Building builders were numerous. First of all, if they had carried out their plans for the mooring mast without taking into account the weight of the dirigible, the building would surely have way too much stress forced on the foundation when it docked. Next, the fact that the dirigible weighs even less than air is both a negative and a positive. The negative side to it is the fierce winds that would take control of the back of the dirigible, making docking incredibly difficult. Above the many pedestrians in the city, this idea was quickly ruled unsafe. Lastly, it was filled with hydrogen, which, naturally, is highly flammable. The use of hydrogen was very dangerous, and only added to the negative side of the project, effectively making the dirigible idea non-viable.
1118	15951	6	3	They were many obstacles the architects of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of those obstacles was the stress of the dirigibles' load and the wind pressure didn't allow to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation, in which was nearly 70 feet below. Another thing that was an obstacle for the architects was it was a lot of money; it was over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework. Also, the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof. The last obstacle was its safety. Most of the dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, which hydrogen is highly flammable. This led to an accident on May 6, 1937, and the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it happened in downtown New York. These are some obstacles the architects of the Empire State Building faced, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan.
1119	15952	6	3	In, The Mooring Mast, by @ORGANIZATION2, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was that the architects could not drop the mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible would add stress to the building's frame, as its weight would be considerable. This means the steel frame would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the extra load. Another setback was that most blimps from outside the United States used hydrogen, and hydrogen is highly flammable, posing a significant safety risk in a densely populated urban environment. Nature itself was the greatest obstacle. The winds on top on the building were always shifting due to the violent air current. If the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around, making docking and passenger transfer dangerous and impractical. Lead weights were an option to stabilize the airship, but using these, where they would be dangling above pedestrians on the street, was not safe, presenting an unacceptable risk of falling debris. The other practical reason why blimps could not moor at the Empire State building was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building, rendering the entire mooring mast project infeasible and ultimately leading to its abandonment.
1120	15953	6	3	There were many different obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle faced was that their expanded use in New York City was hampered by the lack of a suitable landing area. Another obstacle was that most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, posing a significant safety risk in a densely populated area. Those were some of the different obstacles they faced, ultimately contributing to the lack of success in establishing the building as a practical airship terminal.
1121	15954	6	3	On December 11, 1929 a man named Al Smith announced he was building the world's tallest building at 1,250 feet This building was the Empire state building in New York, that would be used for a dirigible mooring But, there would be a few obstacles to face, that would cause the dirigible mooring to not successfully be used. Al Smith announced he was building this mooring mast but did not announce potential obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building would face when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the largest obstacles would be the unpredictable wind factor high above the city, causing the dirigible's back end to sway uncontrollably and making docking incredibly hazardous. Another issue, a significant safety concern, would be having the foreign dirigibles full of flammable gases to be moored too close to a densely populated area, posing an unacceptable risk. Also, before any dirigibles could be moored, constructors had to spend extra time and money to make the building much more sturdy, reinforcing the structure to withstand the immense forces exerted by the massive airships. Ultimately, these challenges proved too significant to overcome, leading to the abandonment of the dirigible mooring concept.
1122	15955	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One was the architects couldn't drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof. The thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. The second problem was the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. The third problem was the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation. It was over sixty thousand dollars worth to make the building's framework stronger. But unfortunately all the problems were unsolved and the height made it undesirable to postpone to a later date; instead of dirigibles becoming the transportation of the future, they had been given way to airplanes, thus ending the docking experiment.
1123	15956	6	3	"When the architects first looked at creating a safe landing zone for the dirigibles they overlooked several key factors. The Empire State building is over @NUM1 feet tall; at those heights the winds become very powerful and would blow the dirigible all over the place. This was proved in paragraph @NUM2. The Goodyear blimp called the ""Columbia"" attempted to reach the mooring mast; although they had a skillful pilot, he could not get the steel framed balloon close enough to dock on the spire. Another factor the architects did not weigh into the equation was that most dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, which is very flammable. If a zeppelin did catch on fire, then that would be one massive ball of fire coming down on the streets of downtown New York. The ""Hindenburg"" disaster gave us the example which was all we needed to see to change our minds about wanting a massive flammable balloon hovering over the streets of New York City. Thus, the impracticality and danger ultimately led to the abandonment of the dirigible mooring plan."
1124	15957	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, there were a few obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One reason was that ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The owners of the Empire State building realized that if a dirigible was destroyed by fire over a density populated area like New York, there could have been a huge accident. One of the greatest obstacles however was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" When the dirigibles would try to dock, they sometimes could not even get close to the building because of the strong winds. By having the dirigibles hanging over pedestrians on the streets of New York, it was considered unpractical and unsafe. Ultimately, the combination of volatile hydrogen, unpredictable winds, and the potential danger to those below proved too significant to overcome. Due to mother nature and safety reasons, the builders of the Empire State building faced a few problems in allowing dirigibles to dock there."
1125	15958	6	3	New York City was the lack of a suitable landing space. Another obstacle was the nature itself; the winds were pushing the dirigible around. The other obstacle was the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. These are the problems that the Empire builders faced, ultimately hindering their vision of widespread transatlantic airship travel to the city.
1126	15959	6	3	"The builders and engineers involved in allowing The Empire State Building to dock dirigibles on a mooring mast around one thousand two hundred and fifty feet in the air faced many obstacles. In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, taken from The Empire State Building, the reader is taken through the journey in allowing dirigibles, or blimps, to refuel and transport passengers atop the Empire State Building. This was not an easy task; in fact it was never achieved. Some reasons for this are the very building itself. The mooring mast was to be on top of the building, and its height and weight and wind pressure on the building was dangerous. In paragraph nine it is stated that: ""Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" But even more than just the building itself, the location of the Empire State Building in densely populated downtown New York created a few major obstacles. First, most international blimps used Hydrogen rather than helium-which is highly Flammable. A fire or explosion in the location that the mooring mast was to be located would be devastating to the city. Secondly, there were shifting winds ""due to violent air currents"" atop the building. They caused the backend of the dirigible to swerve. Weights could not be used on the blimp, though, because of the people below and the height at which everything took place. Finally, there were laws in place against airships flying too low over urban areas. So essentially, the objective of this project could not be reached unless legislation was changed. All of these obstacles made it very hard to dock dirigibles on top of the mooring mast on the Empire State Building. However two blimps did attempt to land there. The U.S. Navy dirigible ""Los Angeles"" and the Goodyear Blimp ""Columbia"" both were unsuccessful in landing due to intense winds and sharp spires of nearby buildings. This project is an example of a beneficial idea which was nearly impossible to execute."
1127	15960	6	3	Based on the excerpt, I don't think they should have attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. According to the excerpt, I think this because something really bad could have happened, and something probably has happened, given the inherent risks involved. But back then they really had no choice except for balloons and, by extension, dirigibles, as heavier-than-air travel was still in its infancy, thus limiting transportation options despite the dangers. Therefore, while the docking attempts were fraught with peril, the limited alternatives made them almost necessary at the time.
1128	15961	6	3	"There were obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In the excerpt the author states nature is one of the biggest problems for the mast. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" The author explains that the wind on top of the buildings were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. ""The winds on top of the buildings were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". The author also describes what the dirigible would do as an affect of the wind. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" These unpredictable air conditions ultimately made docking a dangerous and impractical endeavor."
1129	15962	6	3	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was very hard for them. A dirigible having to dock on the Empire State Building is probably not easy, and this was due to the wind conditions. A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling and also for passengers to disembark. The obstacles were that Al Smith demanded the builders to make the Empire State Building more tall, also to make it more ornamental, and to put in like a pyramid at the top, which was a design change that complicated the original plans. The workers were exhausted by the demands. The one obstacle that the builders faced in expanding their use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area for dirigibles. The other obstacles were that the architects and the builders of the Empire State Building consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations of existing airship facilities. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was by nature itself, specifically the high winds and unpredictable weather conditions at that altitude, which ultimately made docking a dangerous proposition. Therefore, the combination of structural demands, logistical challenges, and environmental factors made the dirigible docking experiment ultimately unsuccessful.
1130	15963	6	3	"This project towards ""transportation of the future"" for the Empire State Building was no easy task. One of the major obstacles was the ""stress to the building's frame"". The workers had to make over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to accommodate the dirigibles, ensuring the skyscraper could withstand the additional weight and pull. This would strengthen the frame of the building so that the wind pressure would be ""transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"". Another issue with this mooring mast was the ""violent air currents"" that were ""constantly shifting"" the winds on the roof, creating unpredictable conditions. This would cause the dirigible to swing around the building while it was docked, making the docking process even more difficult. Allowing these giant aircrafts to ""dangle high above pedestrians on the street"" was ""neither practical nor safe,"" posing a significant risk to public safety. These obstacles caused the workers and architects to postpone the build, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the ambitious dirigible project."
1131	15964	6	3	One of the original purposes of the Empire State Building was to be a loading dock for dirigibles or blimps, envisioned as a modern transportation hub. This was meant to help New York be a leader in modern traveling. Yet there were many obstacles that eventually put an end to the idea of a mooring mast. A major problem was nature itself. The wind on top of the building was constantly changing because of the air currents, making docking extremely difficult. This would cause the dirigible to swing around the mast, posing a hazard. The idea of weighting the back was immediately ruled out because of the danger imposed on the pedestrians on the street below. Also there was a law that stated airships could not fly too low over urban areas, which would make it illegal for any dirigible to tie up or even approach the area, effectively grounding the entire ambitious concept and relegating the mooring mast to a mere historical footnote.
1132	15965	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles when trying to obstruct dirigibles to dock on the top of there building. They faced obstacles like laws, saftay problems, and also natural problems when trying to successed this gutsey idea. They firsted faced the problems of law, ""An existing law aginst airships flying too low over urban areas. This law posed an obstacle for the builders because they would have to dock the blimp without flying in this restricted fly zone. The Second problem was dealing with saftey, ""when dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed... Owners of the Empire State building relized how much worse that accident could have been over downtown New York."" After blimps were proven to be highly flamable the builders saw that an accident over highly populated New York City would be worse than a rural area. Finally the builders face problems with nature, ""dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" The builders relized that the drastic change in wind conditions at the top of the building where not apperate for a blimp. These designers had more than a mundane idea but it was shot down with the multiple obstacles that a-rose. The combination of legal restrictions, safety concerns highlighted by the Hindenburg disaster, and the unpredictable weather conditions at such a great height proved too much to overcome, ultimately grounding the ambitious vision of a dirigible docking station atop the iconic skyscraper."
1133	15966	6	3	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building had to face. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below"". This is stating that the stress of the dirigibles and its shiftiness will put stress on the building's foundation, and they don't want that stress to topple over the building. Also, they say, ""The winds on the top of the building were consistently shifting due to the violent air currents."" This says that they are worried that the wind might take the balloon away from the building, causing it to injure people. These are only a few obstacles the builders had to face, demonstrating the considerable engineering challenges inherent in such an ambitious project."
1134	15967	6	3	The builders faced several obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One of the biggest and hardest obstacles to overcome was safety for everyone. The builders had to worry about the safety of the people coming in and out of the dirigible, the people on the nearby streets, and the people inside the building. The height of the building also made emergency evacuations more complex. Safety concerns were one of the main reasons why the dock was never fully realized. Another huge obstacle that faced the builders was nature. This is true because winds at the top of the tall building were always changing and this would make it hard to land the dirigible on it. Prevailing winds could easily push the airship against the building or make docking maneuvers dangerous. Like the excerpt states in paragraph @NUM1, dirigibles were weighted down in the back by lead weights, and this would cause a problem with pedestrians walking under in the streets, posing a significant risk. Ultimately, the combination of safety concerns and the unpredictable nature of the wind proved insurmountable, leading to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan.
1135	15968	6	3	"There are a couple of obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of these obstacles is that it would add stress to the building's Frame. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"". This additional stress posed a significant engineering challenge. Another obstacle was that the steel would have to be modified. ""The steel of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" This modification implied extra costs and design alterations. These are some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, highlighting the complexities of integrating such an ambitious concept into the existing structure."
1136	15969	6	3	"The idea was kind of unrealistic in the first place. When these dirigibles would try to dock to this building, the structure of the building wouldn't be able to handle the violent winds and the zeppelin. It caused many problems. What if the dirigible attempted to dock and the heavy winds blew its tail end around to hit a building? The Hindenburg, another zeppelin, was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, @ORGANIZATION1. If a disaster like this occurred in such a heavily populated place, it would be chaos. Impractical and unsafe, this plan wouldn't work. They would need something more stable. The plans of this weren't completely thought through; fundamental issues regarding structural integrity and passenger safety were overlooked. All these problems, combined, would cause them to postpone the building of the landing gear. These plans for the ""new"" age of transportation with dirigibles would never happen. Airplanes were a safer and more efficient new way to travel. Consequently, the impracticality of the dirigible docking concept ultimately led to its abandonment in favor of more viable aviation technologies."
1137	15970	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles that prevented dirigibles from docking there. A main concern was safety, especially after the Hindenburg, a German dirigible, was destroyed by fire over New Jersey. This prompted the realization that had such a disaster occurred over New York, a highly populated urban area, it could have been far worse. Another obstacle that was encountered was bad weather conditions. The winds on the top of the Empire State Building were consistently shifting, making it impossible for a dirigible to stay unmoving. If the dirigible was so unsteady, it would be very unsafe for it to be floating above millions of people. Lastly, it was illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the mast or even approach the area due to a law that prevented all airships from flying too low over urban areas. Due to all the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building, it is apparent that dirigibles were simply not meant to dock there, ultimately proving the impracticality of the original design.
1138	15971	6	3	"The idea of the dirigibles docking on the mooring mast was very smart and could've been great. However, the builders of the Empire State Building faced problems when trying to achieve that goal. One problem was the wind forces were too strong to allow a dirigible to dock at the mast. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (∂ @NUM1). This made the docking process incredibly dangerous and unpredictable. Another reason is the safety of the people. Not all dirigibles were made the same. In other countries, dirigibles had different kinds of gases in them ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (∂ @NUM2). Since hydrogen is highly flammable, the builders had to take into consideration how safe people would be flying in a dirigible, as a single spark could have catastrophic consequences. Lastly, there was a law against aircraft flying too close to a populated area. ""... was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."" (∂ @NUM3). This legal obstacle further complicated the already challenging endeavor. The docking at the Empire State Building was a great idea but there were too many challenges that faced the builders, ultimately rendering the plan impractical and unsafe."
1139	15972	6	3	Dirigibles had a top speed of eighty miles per hour. Some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four city blocks in New York City. So the one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith saw an opportunity for his Empire State Building. He proposed a mooring mast added to the top of the building, envisioning that it would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to conveniently let passengers disembark and embark. Dirigibles were to be docked by means of an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the ship and then secured it to a mast, allowing the body to swing in a way that passengers could safely board and exit, presenting a novel solution to the challenge of urban airship travel.
1140	15973	6	3	The problems that the workers had to face in letting the dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building were crucial. First, if they would have tried to put a mooring mast on the top of the building's roof and then have a thousand-pound dirigible on top of it, holding it there would be too much for it to hold. And the stress of the dirigible's weight and wind pressure would need to be transmitted to the building's foundation, which was 11 hundred feet below. The frame of the building would have to be stronger, modified so it could work, but it would be over $1 million to put into the building's framework in order for it to succeed. But the most significant reason why it was difficult for the workers is because of the winds, and if landed, they would need weights to weigh it down, but it would be dangling high above pedestrians, which wasn't practical or safe, making the entire endeavor ultimately unfeasible.
1141	15974	6	3	"While building the Empire State Building many obstacles had occurred. During the process of planning the DESIGN of the building architects started to realize that there could be many complications. Several complications occurred during the process. Architects noticed that the building itself was not made to add additional parts. As an architect said ""it could not simply drop a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" Wind was another harsh factor for the construction of the Empire State Building itself. If ""held by a single cable tether, it would add stress to the buildings frame. The engineers will also muched with the building's issues."" the Steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Safety and nature also had a big play in the obstacles of the building of the Empire State Building. Architects planned out to maintain the dirigibles very high up; wanting to do this could be very dangerous. ""dangling high above pedestrians on the Street, was neither practical or safe. Building the dirigible would have caused many accidents, injuries, and deaths if made. Nature would also be inroled in this plan. ""open landing fields could be weighed down in the back with lead weights. If anyday had very fierce winds this object could have came down and caused serious danger. Therefore, the Empire State Building's construction faced numerous design, safety, and weather-related challenges."
1142	15975	6	3	"Although the builders of the Empire State Building managed some of the obstacles with allowing dirigibles to dock there, many of the issues were left unsolved. When designing the mast to accommodate the blimp, the architects realized the pressure this would put on the building's frame. In order to support the weight of the dirigible they needed to make ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications"" (paragraph @NUM1) to the structure of the building. Also, the builders had to develop a way to tether the dirigible to the building to allow passengers and supplies to unboard, envisioning a seamless transfer process. Therefore, the architects designed a ""rocket-shaped mast... of shiny aluminum... which also housed elevators and stairs"" (paragraph @NUM2), facilitating access to the city below. However, the builders forgot to incorporate the winds at the top of the building. Once the front of the dirigible was docked, the back of the blimp would swivel around irradically, making boarding treacherous. Furthermore, the builders disregarded existing laws that banned dirigibles from flying low over cities, as it states in paragraph @NUM3, adding another layer of complexity. This precaution was due to the safety hazard that these dirigibles posed since they were highly flammable from the hydrogen used, a risk that could not be ignored. These imposing obstacles made the use of the Empire State Building is a dock unrealistic."
1143	15976	6	3	In the excerpt of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 by Marcia Amidon L¸sted the builders went through many obstacles in the attempt to allow dringibles dock on the Empire State Building. At first Al Smith wanted this newly designed building to be the tallest one in the world. Now this 1,250 foot building would reach new heights by adding a top hat to the building and allowing drigible to dock there, enabling passengers to get off and on the blimp, along with the conductor refueling its engine. Although this was a great idea there were many issues that the constructor did not see. This is because the thousand foot dirigible would add stress to the buildings frame, and the wind would also add thousands of dollars in damage. To ensure that no damage or harm would be put on the building or residents of New York the steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be strengthened. This cost the city of New York over @MONEY1 in the hopes of putting it on the map for modern travel, illustrating the substantial investment required to pursue this ambitious vision.
1144	15977	6	3	"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building were lack of area, populated area, and hydrogen is highly flammable. ""Also known today as blimps, dirigibles were actually enormous steel framed balloons, with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium to make them lighter than air."" Hydrogen is very dangerous, flammable, and the Empire State Building is located in a populated area, making any potential accident a significant risk. The destruction of the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, further demonstrated the dangers to the owners of the Empire State Building. Ultimately, another reason dirigibles couldn't moor at the top of the building was the existing law against all airships flying too low over populated areas, rendering the docking plan infeasible. Therefore, these factors combined to prevent the realization of the dirigible docking station."
1145	15978	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. They had to come up with a safe plan which included building designs and figure out problems they failed to see from the beginning. The first obstacle was meeting with the navy and other experts to come up with a safe and practical plan. They had to find a way to land the dirigibles without adding stress to the building's frame and without spending @MONEY1 to strengthen it. The builders came up with a plan that included what the mast would have to be made of and what would be on each floor, considering the weight distribution. They even had to finish the roof before the mooring mast could take place, ensuring a stable base. The largest obstacle was one they failed to see from the beginning: in building the mooring mast, they would have to face obstacles that nature brought, which was simply impossible to overcome. Safety was the main problem; if a fire occurred, there would be a disaster given the flammable nature of the airships. The winds were too strong due to violent air currents, and there was a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over the city. After all this work, they couldn't get past the obstacles, and the mooring mast was never built, ultimately rendering the ambitious plan unfeasible."
1146	15979	6	3	The obstacles the builders faced were many. One of the things they faced was that they didn't know if they wanted to build the tower in the first place. And the other reason was that most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. One of the greater obstacles was the mooring mast itself, and another, equally challenging obstacle was nature itself, with weather conditions often hindering progress and creating safety concerns. Ultimately, these multifaceted challenges tested the builders' resolve.
1147	15980	6	3	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @PERSON1, builders of the Empire State building faced many problems. Their first problem was that the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the flat roof. The weight of the mast would make the framework crumble, so the builders had to modify and strengthen the steel frame of the Empire State building. Secondly, most foreign dirigibles were highly flammable, making it highly dangerous to moor over populated New York City. Also, nature itself was a problem. The winds at the top of the building were just so strong it'd be dangerous to moor there. And finally, the law against dirigibles flying too low over urban areas posed an issue. The mooring mast atop the Empire State building was a good idea, but it was very dangerous, highly unlikely, and against the law."
1148	15981	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle they faced was they could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. ""The thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation, which would have proved to be an expensive undertaking. The second obstacle of allowing dirigibles to dock there was ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (paragraph @NUM2). These unpredictable winds would make it difficult, if not impossible, for dirigibles to safely and consistently moor. Another obstacle they faced was the ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM3). This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area, rendering the docking station useless. Thus, a combination of structural, meteorological, and legal challenges ultimately prevented the Empire State Building from becoming a successful dirigible docking station."
1149	15982	6	3	"The Empire State Building was built as the tallest building in the World and even today still remains one of the tallest. It had design plans with more of a purpose then just being the tallest building, however. It was supposed to serve as a passenger exchange and a refueling dock for dirigibles. Most people do not know this though because there were many complications involved with the architectural designs of this plan for the mast. Architects knew it would not be easy to build such a creation and that they ""could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building."" They knew, for example that the building needed to be modified to accommodate for the added stress from the mast, and the height of the building would need to be increased. They also needed to consider the logistics of transferring passengers and fuel at such a height. They made the necessary changes to the building's designs, but the realities of the project soon set in, and the mast was never built, ""the greatest reason being for safety."" The hydrogen used to power the dirigibles was highly flammable and endangered the citizens of New York. Also, according to the article, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" There are powerful winds at that high of an altitude that would blow and make it difficult for the dirigibles to be properly controlled and navigated, ultimately rendering the ambitious plan impractical."
1150	15983	6	3	"Based on ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to anchor at the top of the building. A dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether adds stress to the buildings frame, the architects needed to find a way to transmit the stress of the wind pressure and dirigibles load to the building's foundation. Safety had played a major role in the fate of the mooring mast. Outside the United States most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, hydrogen is highly flammable. If a dirigible was to catch fire above a densely populated area there would be disaster, specifically for New York City. The greatest obstacle to the use of the mooring mast was nature. Above the Empire State Building the wind was constantly shifting due to violent air currents, even if a dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast the back of the shape would still be unstable to land. Ultimately, these factors contributed to the impracticality of the mooring mast concept."
1151	15984	6	3	"In the excerpt written by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, she describes the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In the excerpt the author told the readers that after building the Empire State Building the builders had to reconstruct the entire building, having to make it stronger to support the top. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation"" (paragraph @NUM1). The workers of the building also had to be working at a height of 1,250 feet, adding to the complexity and danger of the task. They not only had to rebuild the foundation and strength of the building, but also the top mooring mast. ""Two months after the workers celebrated framing the entire building, they were back to raise an American flag again - this time at the top of the frame for the mooring mast."" These challenges highlight the impressive engineering feats and the demanding conditions under which the workers constructed this iconic landmark, showcasing the dedication required to pursue such an ambitious vision."
1152	15985	6	3	"Obstacles the builders had to face with the Empire State Building was that they did not have the technology to land a dirigible on the mooring mast. In February 1931, @CAPS1 Clavan of the building's architectural office said, ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear."" After @CAPS1 Clavan said that, the use of dirigibles had disappeared; by the late 1930s, the dirigibles had been given way to airplanes. Builders also had to construct an electric winch and gang plank; the electric winch would haul in a line from the front of the ship to be tied to the mast, and the gang plank would lead to an open observation platform. Ultimately, the impracticality of safely mooring airships at that height led to the abandonment of the dirigible landing plan, marking a shift in aviation technology."
1153	15986	6	3	"It was once said ""where there is a will there is a way"". However, they didn't include the part about the obstacles you will have to go through. For instance, there was a will and way for the docking of dirigibles on the Empire State Building; the architects just didn't work out all the possible problems of their idea. Like the fact that only American dirigibles used helium instead of hydrogen, making foreign airships unsuitable. Also, the wind currents have a stronger force that high up in the air than at regular life level. Also, the un-ideal place they were trying to use was a factor. They should've taken heed to the businessman's slogan ""LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION,"" highlighting that even with the best intentions, impracticalities can render an idea unworkable."
1154	15987	6	3	"At sporting events, people have gotten used to seeing the MetLife blimp or the Goodyear blimp. Now they are used for advertising but not many people know that they were once thought of as transportation. The excerpt ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Popular Science, shows not only the original purpose for the mast of the Empire State building was for mooring blimps, but also shows the many problems faced with blimp travel. Safety was a big issue because the blimps, or dirigibles, were filled with Hydrogen, which is highly flammable. It would be a huge disaster if one of them exploded over New York City. Another problem was that the winds were always changing and there was no way to keep the dirigibles from moving in the wind and it could be dangerous. There was, also, a law about how low you can fly over urban areas and in order to land correctly, you would be breaking that law, and flying that low would risk wind pushing the dirigible into the top of the building and puncturing it. Al Smith had a good idea for the Empire State Building's mast, however there were too many problems to make it a reality."
1155	15988	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The man who came up with the plan was Al Smith, who saw the opportunity to add a mooring mast to the top of the building. This would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers on or off. But with this came lots of work. And they couldn't simply drop a mooring mast on top of the building. The architects had to make plans on how they were going to set up the mooring mast, ensuring its stability and integration with the existing structure. Once the architects had designed the mooring mast and made changes to the existing plans for the building's skeleton, construction proceeded as planned. When the building had been framed to the 85th floor, the roof had to be completed before the framing for the mooring mast could take place. The mast also had a skeleton of steel and was clad in stainless steel with glass windows, a testament to the innovative engineering required for this ambitious project.
1156	15989	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted the builders faced obsticals in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. An obstacle they faced was A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, this added stress to the buildings frame. The stress of the blimp's load plus wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. The steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be strengthened to accommodate this immense weight and force, presenting a substantial engineering challenge. These structural considerations were crucial to ensuring the safety and stability of the building."
1157	15990	6	3	They had to build the tower just right or els there would be landing problems if they added the sight seeing thing. People would pay any price, but the price of keeping it stable was not worth the effort initially. In the end, the people were going to make this a very popular thing, but it was not up to them if it was or was not popular. Wind and landing always stood in there way, so they paid a lot of money to restabilize the building. This ended up being a profit and a ride of a lifetime, ultimately proving the investment worthwhile and ensuring its long-term success.
1158	15991	6	3	During the construction of the Empire State Building, there were several obstacles the builders faced to have the dirigibles be able to dock on the Empire State Building. The first obstacle the builders faced was figuring out how to modify and strengthen the steel frame of the Empire State Building to accommodate the mooring mast on top of the building. These modifications would cost over sixty thousand dollars, which was a lot of money back in the 1930's. Once the builders finished framing the entire building, the greatest obstacle to constructing the mooring mast came to be. This obstacle was nature itself. Violent air currents would have the back of the blimps swivel around and around the mast. The blimp would need weights to hold it steady, but these weights would be hanging over people on the street and this was neither practical nor safe, thus rendering the blimp docking idea ultimately unfeasible.
1159	15992	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Dirigibles were said to be hailed as the transportation of the future, however in New York City there was a lack of a suitable landing area. The speed at which dirigibles traveled and the area and heights wind speed became unquestionable. The dirigible plan became more and more unreasonable with an accident occurring in Lakehurst, New Jersey. For the height, wind, speed, and location, using dirigibles was no longer a good idea.
1160	15993	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced the obstacle of striving for perfection, particularly to satisfy the designers. They invested much work, effort, and time. They experimented with different arrangements for government officials. The dirigibles were consistently close to the mooring mast, leading to concerns about potential damage. There was also the hope that dirigibles would become a key mode of future transportation, rivaling airplanes. Instead, the dirigible mooring mast became the location for the world's highest soda fountain and tea garden for sightseers. Ultimately, their initial plans for the mooring mast did not materialize as envisioned, but the building's other features and success proved to be more than satisfactory."
1161	15994	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a lot of obstacles in trying to dock dirigibles there, but they had to figure a way around. The architects believed that the mooring mast would work and they started building. Soon enough, problems evolved that could not be fixed. An example of one of their problems is that dirigibles use more hydrogen than helium, which makes it very flammable. If the dirigible had an accident over New York many people would be hurt, due to the highly combustible nature of hydrogen. Another factor that goes with this is the wind currents. The wind is too strong that the dirigible would be swirling around even if it was tied up. However, they could use lead weights to keep it still but if they fell it would hurt some pedestrians walking by. Furthermore, the state law made it illegal for airships to fly too low which made it impossible for dirigibles to be tied to the mooring mast on the Empire State Building. After all these problems, the architects never added the landing gear to the mooring mast because they knew that it would not be used as it was intended to, rendering the ambitious dirigible docking plan ultimately unfeasible.
1162	15995	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders faced obstacles in an attempt as to allowing dirigibles to dock. One example of an obstacle that the builders had to face was how to attach the mooring mast on top of the building. In paragraph nine it says, ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" They had to come up with a safe and secure way to attach it, ensuring it wouldn't compromise the building's integrity. Another example of an obstacle was that they had to strengthen and modify the building because in paragraph nine it stated that ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" This additional weight and potential for movement required significant reinforcement. The last example was in paragraph nine when they explained that ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" The stress might be so much for the building that it could cause the building to collapse, therefore, the structural engineers needed to account for every possible scenario. In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted the builders faced many obstacles as to allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building in New York City."
1163	15996	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" the builders of the Empire State Building would have faced many consequences in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A regular sized dirigible was made of ""enormous steel framed balloons."" They went as fast as ""eighty miles per hour, and could cruise at seventy per hour."" The Empire State Building's designers would have faced the problem of a ""building dangling high above pedestrians on the street,"" which ""was neither practical nor safe."" And even if the dirigible landed there, the ship would ""swivel around and around"" due to wind, which would have made the building unstable. Therefore, even if the ship could land there, it was ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area,"" making the entire mooring mast concept ultimately unfeasible."
1164	15997	6	3	"Other than making ammendments to building plans, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in safety, practicality, and legality. The hydrogen used in most foreign dirigibles is highly flammable, posing as an extreme safety hazard ""above a densely populated area such as downtown New York,"" especially given the potential for leaks or accidents during docking. Also, due to natural, violent wind currents at the altitude of the mooring mast, it would be more difficult, and dangerous, to weigh down docking dirigibles, increasing the risk of uncontrolled movement and potential disaster. Lastly, the building plans for the Empire State Building did not correspond to existing laws. Laws forbade airships from traveling at low altitudes over urban areas; therefore the use of the mooring mast would be illegal, essentially rendering that feature unusable under current regulations. Before the builders were able to finish the Empire State Building, they had to carefully consider each of these obstacles, ultimately leading them to abandon the airship mooring mast concept, thus ensuring the building's completion and compliance with safety and legal standards."
1165	15998	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Originally, the greatest problem builders faced was strengthening the building's foundational base in order to support the stress of the dirigibles' load and the wind pressure. To combat this, a lot of modifications had to made to the building's framework. Unfortunately, most of the complications of the mooring mast were not considered until after it was built. A most important one was safety, in that that many foreign dirigibles were to use hydrogen to float, which is highly flammable. A disaster like the Hindenburg disaster over New York City is too dangerous to risk. Another preventer of the mast were the winds at the top of the building that were constantly changing due to the violent air currents. The swaying dirigible could not be secured with hanging weights due to the danger of dropping one over a very populated New York City. A huge complication of making the dream a reality was a law preventing airships from flying too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal for a docking to ever take place. The many obstacles that faced the builders of the Empire State building attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, eventually led to the dropping of the idea all together.
1166	15999	6	3	The Empire State Building builders faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. Another obstacle the builders faced was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, hindering any safe approach. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building, or even approach the area, although two dirigibles did attempt to reach the building before the entire idea was dropped, ultimately proving the impracticality and danger of the endeavor.
1167	16000	6	3	"It is stated in the article that ""[t]he mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill it purpose,"" and that proves to be true. The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in trying to have dirigibles dock at the building. For example, one obstacle that is faced is that most dirigibles are filled with hydrogen which is an extremely flammable gas, and if a dirigible is destroyed by fire like the Hindenburg it could cause a terrible accident in a heavily populated area like New York. Therefore the builders face an obstacle of a safety issue with the dirigibles if one catches on fire in New York. Another important obstacle is that strong wind currents at the top of the Empire State Building causes the dirigibles to swivel around the mooring mast, which causes the dirigibles to not get close enough to the mooring mass. Also the wind creates a risk that a dirigible could be blown onto a sharp spire of another building, and the dirigible could be punctured which causes a dangerous situation for the captain. To weigh down the dirigible so that it does not swivel as much in the wind, the controllers would have to use lead weights. Though the lead weights lessen the swiveling it is not practical or safe because lead weights would be hanging above pedestrians on the street, and if a lead weight fell it could be fatal. Lastly, if the dirigible to moor at the Empire State Building it would be breaking an existing law. This law states that airships can not fly to low over urban areas, so it is clear that it is illegal to moor on the Empire State Building. Before this project was started the builders should have researched or accounted for all the obstacles they were going to face, and ultimately it was these oversights that doomed the mooring mast to obsolescence."
1168	16001	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles such as structural support issues, shifting winds, and administrative interference. One major problem arose when they realized the force of holding the blimp in place ""would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"" (par. @NUM1). This meant builders had to make changes to the support system of the building itself before being able to begin construction on the mooring device. Once the mast and reconstruction work completed, builders realize that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (par. @NUM2), which would make docking almost impossible. Attempts to moor became even more difficult as ""complete dirigible mooring equipment had never been installed"" (par. @NUM3). This shows how builders struggled with bureaucracy in their attempts to build the mooring mast. In conclusion, the shortsightedness of the project caused builders to struggle with the building's structure, weather, and the owners' vision, before ultimately abandoning the mast."
1169	16002	6	3	The obstacles the builders had to go through were pretty hard. It was hard because the building was so high up in the air, presenting challenges with wind and stability. They needed special gear to do it, including safety harnesses and specialized tools for working at such altitudes. Al Smith had to wait for an answer before building the mast because it was dangerous work requiring careful planning and approval. Over sixty thousand dollars had to be made to complete the building framework, representing a significant financial hurdle. The other obstacles were to design the building to drop and let passengers on and off easily. Also, to refuel your dirigibles if you had one, making it a functional airship terminal. And it was just to make the building bigger, increasing its capacity and overall scale. These combined challenges made the construction a significant undertaking.
1170	16003	6	3	The builders faced many obstacles when attempting to allow the dirigibles to dock. The first was that they couldn't just put the mast on top of the building; it would have put too much stress on the building's frame. They had to transmit the stress all the way down to the foundation of the building, reinforcing it significantly. They did over @MONEY1 worth of framework to the building, a costly but necessary measure. Their next obstacle was to find a safe way to dock and unload the ships, which proved impossible. First off, the ship couldn't even reach the building because the violent, ever-changing winds were too much to control the ship in. But even if they did dock, the back of the ship would have been pushed around and around the mast, creating a dangerous situation. Another obstacle was a law that prevented airships from flying that low over urban areas. So, the ships couldn't ever legally approach the building to tie off to the mast, effectively grounding the entire project.
1171	16004	6	3	"Although the problems with docking a dirigible were not considered in the beginning, the builders of the Empire State building faced these obstacles eventually. Their ""greatest reason was one of safety"" for the passengers and pedestrians below in the city. Many countries ""used hydrogen rather than helium"" in their dirigibles, and ""hydrogen is highly flammable"" which could have caused several problems in the future. A German dirigible called Hindenburg was destroyed in Lakehurst, New Jersey because of fire, and it was after that incident that the owners of the Empire State building realized that an accident like that could not take place ""above a densely populated area such as downtown New York,"" because too many people could be injured. Even though safety was a large problem, ""the greatest obstacle... was nature itself."" when a dirigible was ""tethered to the mooring mast,"" the violent air currents at the top of the building would cause the ""back of the ship [to] swivel around and around."" The air currents not only made it hard to hold the dirigible steady, it made it extremely challenging to even reach the mooring mast. The idea of using lead weights to hold down the end of the blimps was not used because dangleing weights above New York City ""was neither practical nor safe."" One last obstacles the builders faced was the existing ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law prevented any dirigibles from being tied to or even approach the building. However, two blimbs (Los Angeles from U.S. Navy and the Goodyear blimp from Goodyear) did try to reach the building but were stopped due to the wind speeds. The several obstacles that presented themselves to the builders of the Empire State Building prevented the mooring mast from being used for the future of transportation."
1172	16005	6	3	In the @CAPS1 The @CAPS2 Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles. The largest obstacle they faced was safety; most dirigibles coming from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is very flammable. Another obstacle was just nature itself. Winds were constantly shifting, caused by violent air currents. Another obstacle was there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The builders should have realized all the hazards they were facing and just dropped the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers, as the risks clearly outweighed any potential benefits.
1173	16006	6	3	Architects once envisioned a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building in New York to dock dirigibles, now known as blimps. This skinny tower would allow these airships to dock at the building's peak. The Empire State Building stands @NUM1 feet tall without the mooring mast. The stress exerted by a dirigible on a mooring mast at @NUM2 feet is substantial, especially at that height. They invested @MONEY1 in modifications to the building's base to support this endeavor. A significant drawback of dirigibles, particularly those using helium, is their flammability, potentially leading to millions in damage. A zeppelin fire over a densely populated area could result in a tragic loss of life. Despite these risks, the mooring mast was a bold idea that contributed to the building's reign as the tallest structure of its time, but realistically with the safety concerns it is probably best that they do not use the mooring mast today.
1174	16007	6	3	Due to the architects being blind to the potential problems of the mast, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. There was a law saying that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. This made it illegal for a ship to even go near the building. But say a ship got tethered to the mooring mast, the back end of the ship would swivel around the mast due to constant shifting winds because of violent air currents. Dirigibles are normally moored in open fields which allows the backs to be weighted down with lead weights to prevent swaying. This was dangerous for many reasons but mainly because the weights would be hanging over downtown New York. Without the dirigible being held down the violent winds would push the ship into sharp spires that would rip the shell. With the wind pressure and the dirigible's load itself there would be too much stress being added to the building's frame. The building's steel frame, over sixty thousand dollars in modifications would have to be made so the stress would be able to be transmitted nearly eleven hundred feet down to the foundation. Most of the dirigibles that were made outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is more flammable so the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it were over downtown New York. With all of these obstacles in their way the owners and builders of the Empire State Building voted to postpone the installation of the landing gear, ultimately recognizing that the mooring mast plan was simply impractical and fraught with peril.
1175	16008	6	3	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted the builders went through many obstacles to get their **vision** done. The builders thought they had everything all set and under control. When they had made their plans they had planned for the mast to be a big piece. When they had made the mast it just wasn't right. ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose."" Then they had more problems because a law was being passed that the ships could not tie themselves to the buildings; they wouldn't have anyone visit the building. But they solved that problem by having the airplanes bring the passengers. Even though the builders went through many obstacles, they still managed to get past them, ultimately adapting their initial concept to the changing circumstances."
1176	16009	6	3	"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the reader learns about many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The most important obstacle to overcome was safety. The United States used hydrogen rather than helium to power the dirigibles. As said in @CAPS2 @NUM1, after the Hindenburg was destroyed, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how catastrophic the accident would be if it was over a densely populated area such as New York. Another obstacle faced was the brutal winds which occur at such a high altitude. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@CAPS2 @NUM2). The final obstacle the builders faced was that there was a law, ""against airships flying too low over urban areas."" (@CAPS2 @NUM3) which made it illegal to tie a dirigible to a building. These high-flying dreams were proving impractical. In conclusion the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles yet in the end, ""Dirigibles, instead of becoming the transportation of the future, had given way to airplanes"" (@CAPS2 @NUM4)."
1177	16010	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One clear obstacle was the law that had existed at the time making it against the law for airships to fly too low over urban areas, a regulation designed to ensure public safety and prevent potential accidents in densely populated areas (paragraph @NUM1). Also, another obstacle in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building was that most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flamable. For example on May 6, 1937 the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been it had taken place in downtown New York, with the potential for catastrophic loss of life and widespread damage to the surrounding infrastructure (paragraph @NUM2). The greatest obstacle was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. If the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast, making docking a dangerous and impractical endeavor (paragraph @NUM3). The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced were too much to allow dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the ambitious plan.
1178	16011	6	3	"Throughout the excerpt, obstacles the builders faced were difficult. Many fell under being able to let dirigibles dock there. Some difficulties they faced were that outside from the states, more dirigibles were being made, but with ""hydrogen rather than helium."" They stated, ""hydrogen is highly flammable."" There was fear for the people, since New York was so densely populated, making any potential accident catastrophic. There were also weather problems, especially unpredictable winds. ""Ship would swivel around and around,"" making docking extremely perilous. Realizing the danger, and the limited ways to mitigate the threat posed by hydrogen-filled airships in a crowded city, all they could do was shut it down, ending the ambitious project."
1179	16012	6	3	"In the construction of the Empire State building the planners faced plenty of problems before and after the making of the mast. There were laws preventing the docking of the dirigibles, incidents that had occured, and flaws in safety. The first problem they should have turned their attention to was the law against low-flying aircraft over urban areas. It is said that ""this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up or even approach the area,"" essentially rendering the docking station useless from a legal standpoint. Another problem faced was the burning of the Hindenburg. The U.S. used helium to keep their dirigibles afloat while other countries were using highly-flammable hydrogen. This posed a big threat and planners even started to wonder ""how much worse that incident would be if it had taken place above a densely populated area like downtown New York,"" increasing the potential for catastrophe. The final problem was how un-safe it was to have a dirigible swaying in the intense winds near the building. The cargo would send the dirigible out of control in these winds. The mast on the Empire State Building had too many problems for the planners to solve. It would never make it from the start, as the combination of legal restrictions, safety concerns, and practical difficulties proved insurmountable."
1180	16013	6	3	To allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, the architects had many obstacles to face. Some of the obstacles were that a mooring mast could not be simply dropped and a thousand foot dirigible moored at the top would add stress to the building's frame. The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. The greatest obstacle to the mooring mast was nature itself. The construction of the Empire State Building had obstacles to face. These challenges ultimately shaped the project's design and feasibility.
1181	16014	6	3	"In the excerpt the builders had faced many obstacles in order for dirigibles to dock there. They had faced many challenges. One of the main concerns was safety, particularly given the size and nature of the airships. Al Smith had commented saying ""They were trying to figure some safe way of mooring airships to this mast."" This highlights the innovative problem-solving required to secure these massive vehicles, ensuring the well-being of both passengers and ground crew. Therefore, safety was a crucial consideration during the construction and design phases."
1182	16015	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced by attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were harsh. The builders, in theory, thought everything would work perfectly. They had to face that they did not do enough to see if there would be any problems with having the dirigibles dock there, especially concerning the wind and maneuverability. As I read I noticed the building never fulfilled it's purpose. This was because most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen, not helium, hydrogen is very flammable. On May 6, 1937, the Hindenburg disaster occurred, and the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse a fire could have been if it were to happen above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. So in reality this idea was not safe and the builders had to go through building it, having it all done, and then realizing the idea was not pursuable, rendering that aspect of the building obsolete.
1183	16016	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building were so determined to make sure everything would work out fine. The ambitious plan included an intended dirigible mooring mast, but high winds and logistical challenges quickly proved daunting. The building just wasnt ment for dirigibles to dock there.
1184	16017	6	3	"When the builders of the Empire State Building attempted to construct a mooring mast for dirigibles, they were faced with several obstacles that would ultimately defeat them. The first and most obvious obstacle was the danger of crashing. When the Hindenburg crashed in New Jersey, the builders realized how much worse the horrific crash would have been in downtown New York. Another more present obstacle was the wind at the top of the tower. As said in paragraph @NUM1 ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" That coupled with the lightweight nature of dirigibles would make mooring much more difficult than on an open field, requiring extreme precision. The last obstacle faced by builders was the existing laws that made it illegal. There were laws that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas like New York City, though they were largely ignored. All those obstacles eventually lead to the realization that the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building was not practical or feasible."
1185	16018	6	3	Based on the information I just read the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced was finding a way to allow dirigibles to dock there. There are rooms that have never been opened to the public, located near what was intended to be the highest observation desk. They had to make room for a dock, but they didn't know how. The builders' difficulties were compounded by the city, which didn't want dirigibles to moor at the Empire State Building because of a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. They also had complications because the captains of the dirigibles seemingly could not let go of the control levers. Furthermore, the sharp spires of other buildings could potentially puncture the dirigibles. The wind was also a significant problem, as it could take the dirigibles off course. Ultimately, these converging issues made the dirigible docking plan an unworkable proposition.
1186	16019	6	3	"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there include: hydrogen gas being highly flammable, high winds and wind shifts at the top of the building, laws that airships could not fly too low over cities such as New York City. The problem of hydrogen gas came to them when a blimp blew up in New Jersey, then the owners realized how bad it could've been in the city, considering the potential for a catastrophic explosion. When it comes to high winds the excerpt says, ""... if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around..."" potentially causing dangerous instability. Also, the law mentioned would have made it illegal for blimps to come close to the Empire State Building, rendering the entire docking plan legally problematic. These factors ultimately made the dirigible docking idea impractical and unsafe."
1187	16020	6	3	"The builders had many troubles with the building of the Empire State building. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. This is one trouble they had because if the dirigibles ever was an accident above New York City it would be bad because New York is so polluted. Another problem was"", they could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof. This was a big problem because now they had to fix their design, and additional engineering work was needed. Lastly, another problem was the competition, ""Al Smith realized that he was close to losing the title of the world's tallest building."" Al Smith was so caught up in his design he did not realize the competition, which caused some delays. So when he found out he knew had to make his taller, adding more floors to solidify its place in history. These challenges ultimately contributed to the iconic structure we know today."
1188	16021	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that a dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable, would add stress to the building's frame. The steel frame of the building would have to be modified and strengthened to withstand the stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, causing the ship to swivel around and around the mooring mast, making boarding and disembarking extremely difficult and dangerous. Another major obstacle was that there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal for the ships to ever tie up or even approach the building, effectively rendering the mooring mast useless. The last obstacle the builders had to get around was the issue with safety. Most dirigibles used either helium or hydrogen, both highly flammable gases. When the Hindenburg was destroyed by fire, the builders realized how dangerous that could be over a populated area, especially with the potential for catastrophic accidents. These are just some of the many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building had to take into consideration when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the ambitious plan.
1189	16022	6	3	The obstacles builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock included making sure they didn't bump into other buildings. They used ropes to drop down papers, trying to ensure the dirigibles did not pop if they touched the building. They were also trying to keep the dirigibles away so they wouldn't get too close, and that's why they were dropping the papers down with ropes. A tunnel for the dirigibles could have prevented contact with the building, thus eliminating the risk of them popping.
1190	16023	6	3	"In this excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacles in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast. One of the greatest obstacles was one of safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" An accident where a German dirigible caught fire and was destroyed, shocked the builders, but they realized it could have been worse given the building's height and prominence. Nature itself was also a problem. ""Winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The back of the ship would ""swivel"" around even if it was tethered, creating a dangerous situation for passengers and ground crew alike. Also there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which further complicated the docking process and potentially violated existing regulations. All of these examples would cause the builders to face obstacles that ultimately made the dirigible docking plan unfeasible."
1191	16024	6	3	"Many problems faced the construction workers of the Empire State building, primarily in allowing dirigibles to dock. To begin, construction for dirigibles on the Empire State building was dangerous. Dirigibles couldn't do many basic things to dock at the building. For example ""dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building."" (@CAPS2 @NUM1) Mooring was impossible because it was against ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" (@CAPS2 @NUM1) This made it illegal for a ship to tie to the Empire State Building, hindering the intended purpose. Also, the greatest threat to dirigibles was nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@CAPS2 @NUM3) Because of this and the fact that construction on such a high building at the time was unpracticable, dirigibles never touched the Empire State building. So to close, the difficulty of building dirigible landing gear and of landing dirigibles ultimately ended the Empire State Building docks."
1192	16025	6	3	"In their attempt to build a docking mast on the top of the Empire State Building, the builders came up on structural, safety, and practicality obstacles. In order to have the mast on top of the building the builders had to strengthen the steel, ""Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications"" were required to ensure the building could withstand the added stress. Also, they had safety concerns about letting a dirigible dock in a city, on a skyscraper. One of these concerns was the use of the flammable gas hydrogen that was used in non-American dirigibles. If a dirigible caught fire over the city the effects of it would be bad, causing immense damage and potential loss of life. Furthermore, the tether system of the mooring mast was at the will of nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting,"" this meant the dirigible on the mast could then swivel around, making it a danger to citizens below. The mast was also impractical, due to a law that prohibits airships from flying too low over urban areas, making docking difficult if not impossible. And finally, in later years dirigibles had ""given way to airplanes,"" thus making the mooring mast for dirigibles useless and obsolete. The builders of the Empire State Building never succeeded in their attempt of putting an active mooring mast on top of the building, because of structural, safety, and practicality obstacles that they stumbled upon."
1193	16026	6	3	"When the builders of the Empire State Building attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there, they came across many issues. One is the stress on the building from the added mast. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all they way down to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below, @CAPS1 how the stress factors on the building troubled its construction. Another obstacle to its construction was that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". When building the dock, constructors ran into issues which eventually overcame them and led to its uselessness."
1194	16027	6	3	"In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced a few problems. First, they had to figure out a practical way this could be done. When they decided to construct a ""rocket-shaped mast"" that the dirigible could attach to, they realized that the roof had to be built first. After the building of the mast was completed, saftey became an issue. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (paragraph @NUM1) The use of hydrogen, instead of non-flammable helium, posed an explosion risk. If there were ever an accident with a foreign dirigible, the safety of New York City would be at risk. Also, the dirigibles could not be tied down with weights like they can in an open field. This would also be unsafe for the people of New York. The main obstacle the builders faced was safety, which is a big issue. Therefore, given the significant safety concerns, the dirigibles could not dock on the Empire State Building."
1195	16028	6	3	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders faced one giant obstacle. They faced the risk of blowing up the building. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This is one example from the excerpt that could turn into the biggest obstacle. If one were to explode above this building then the building would be destroyed. And a lot of people would die from it too, a catastrophic event that underscored the inherent dangers of mooring hydrogen-filled airships to such a structure. That is one of the biggest obstacles they faced."
1196	16029	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles while trying to set up the mooring mast for dirigibles including a weakened framework, nature and weather, potential fire hazards, and U.S. laws. Because the building was not originally designed to hold down dirigibles, the frame was not sturdy enough to survive the pulling and moving of the blimp in the air, especially considering the immense size and weight of these airships. The dirigibles would also be vacillating in the high and unpredictable winds at the top of the building, which was 102 storeys. Aside from pulling loose or damaging the building itself, the dirigibles were in danger of being punctured by another building's spire. Damage to the dirigible in any way was a very dangerous possibility, as the area in New York City around the Empire State Building is densely populated. If the dirigible were to catch fire and blowup, such as the case with the German Hindenburg blimp, many pedestrians or other structures could be seriously damaged. This kind of catastrophe was also probable because of the flammable gases like hydrogen used to keep the blimps afloat. Finally, the builders of the Empire State Building faced problems with the U.S. government, whose laws forbid airships to come that close to urban areas like New York City. It would be illegal for a dirigible to fly near enough to the building to moor to it. In conclusion, many issues surfaced for the builders as they attempted to transform the Empire State Building into a docking station for dirigibles, ultimately rendering the ambitious plan impractical and unsafe.
1197	16030	6	3	The Empire State Building's planners initially envisioned a dirigible mast atop the skyscraper, a futuristic port for airships where passengers could disembark and cargo could be efficiently transferred. However, the challenges proved immense. Powerful updrafts around the building made maneuvering and mooring a dirigible incredibly dangerous, and high winds further complicated the docking process, threatening to push the massive airships into the building's structure. The sheer height of the building exposed the docking dirigibles to unpredictable weather conditions, making scheduled arrivals and departures unreliable. Ultimately, these insurmountable obstacles led to the abandonment of the dirigible mast concept, marking it as an ambitious but ultimately impractical feature.
1198	16031	6	3	The problems @CAPS1 faced with building dirigibles to dock there was a lack of suitable land area, and the mooring mast could not be simply dropped on the Empire State Building's flat roof. On top of that, a dirigible a thousand feet up, held by a cable tether, would add a lot of stress to the @CAPS2 frame; the stress of the dirigible load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way down to the @CAPS2 foundation. And the other reason was a safety reason; most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, making the whole endeavor far too risky to even consider.
1199	16032	6	3	"Builders of the Empire State Building were faced with many obstacles of construction, especially in regards to allowing dirigibles, or blimps, to dock there. From the beginning, builders were faced with obstacles of very high expectations. Expectations including the desired title of ""world's Tallest Building"". With this desired title came many underlying obstacles like frame and support. Another obstacle also arose: being ""equipped for an age of transportation,"" as said by John Tauranac. With the desire to now be a dock for what was known at the time as the ""transportation of the future"", came even greater obstacles. These obstacles included the responsibility of getting passengers safely off the dirigibles. One of the biggest obstacles was constantly shifting winds and violent air currents. This problem normally solved in open fields using dangling weight belts, was nearly impossible to fix in populated New York City. The final obstacle that really led to the operation's demise, was the law against airships flying too low in urban areas, which ultimately made the dirigible docking concept impractical and unsafe."
1200	16033	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were the lack of land area, the currents of the wind, and the gas used to make dirigibles float. The lack of land area was a problem because ""...some [dirigibles] were as long as 800 ft., The same length as four blocks in New York City."" This could be a problem because in a densely populated area like New York, people could be in danger of having large objects flying to and fro, so close to the ground. It would also obscure light, potentially impacting businesses and residents. The wind currents were a factor because 102 floors above the ground, the wind would buffet large dirigibles around, which would be a danger to the building's frame. ""...the wind pressure would have to be transmitted to the building's foundation,"" requiring significant structural reinforcement. The final obstacle would be the gas used in many foreign dirigibles of the time, which was hydrogen, a highly flammable and dangerous gas to have in densely populated areas like New York City. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in New Jersey, [they] realized how much worse the accident could have been in New York,"" highlighting the immense risk and ultimately leading to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan."
1201	16034	6	3	"There were many obstacles that got in the way of landing dirigibles on the Empire State Building. Most of these had to do with the framework of the building and safety. Workers encountered obstacles with the new plan of mooring blimps even before they started constructing, as engineers had to consider the immense weight and stress a moored airship would place on the structure. To be able to support the air crafts, the frame of the building would have to be ""modified and strengthened,"" or else there was no way the building would stay standing. Safety was the main issue with fulfilling the plan to moor blimps to the Empire State Building, a concern that loomed large over the ambitious project. After everything was built and finished, it was soon realized that the ""mooring mast was destined to never fulfill its purpose"". Some reasons for this were because foreign dirigibles were made mostly of hydrogen, which is highly flammable and extremely unsafe, posing a catastrophic fire risk in the heart of the city. Also, just attaching a dirigible to the mast would be dangerous due to winds that were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents"", making the docking procedure perilous. Not only was unsafe to moor dirigibles to the tallest building in the world, but it was also illegal. Airships were not allowed to fly too low over populated areas, further hindering any practical use of the mast. After the construction of the mooring mast, it was soon realized that would never be used, rendering the elaborate plans and structural modifications ultimately futile."
1202	16035	6	3	In the story The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The @NUM1 main obstacles the builders faced where, hydrogen being highly flammable. The second main reason was winds from nature itself. The last reason was the law against airships. The first main obstacle the builders were faced with was there was hydrogen and helium in the balloon and the hydrogen was highly flammable, so the builders needed to make a safe place for the dirigibles to dock. The second main obstacle the builders were faced with was nature itself. The winds from on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The last obstacle the builders were faced with was the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for ships to ever tie up or approach a building in that area. Ultimately, these considerable safety and legal concerns proved insurmountable. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, but in the end Dirigibles, instead of becoming the transportation of the future, had given way to airplanes.
1203	16036	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the lack of a suitable landing area at that height. Also, a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add considerable stress to the building's frame. To implement the mooring system, they would need a lot of money, like sixty thousand dollars for the necessary modifications. Another reason was safety because most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, thus posing a significant fire hazard. But the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself, as the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making docking an extremely precarious and ultimately impractical endeavor.
1204	16037	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a lot of problems in attempting to allow dirigibles. One is that in the story it says that dirigibles use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. A tear in the dirigible's skin could lead to a catastrophic fire if the escaping hydrogen were ignited. Another problem was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making a stable mooring nearly impossible. The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships lying too low over urban areas, further complicating the logistics and safety considerations. These obstacles ultimately proved insurmountable, dashing the hopes of establishing the building as an airship terminal.
1205	16038	6	3	Their were many obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, presenting a significant fire hazard in the heart of New York City. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mass, making passenger transfer difficult and potentially dangerous. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights to stabilize them, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe, as any dropped weight could cause serious injury. These logistical and safety concerns ultimately proved insurmountable, leading to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan.
1206	16039	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the greatest obstacles they had to face were the winds at the top of the building because the winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. It also wasn't safe having the dirigibles weighed down with lead weights so it won't swivel around the mooring mast, especially considering the added stress on the structure. Also, sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework to accommodate the docking apparatus. They were scared that weighing the ship down with lead weights would be dangerous because of all the people below in the city, as any mishap could have catastrophic consequences. It must have been very hard to construct the mooring mast, given the height and the engineering challenges involved, making the entire endeavor a difficult undertaking.
1207	16040	6	3	The Mooring Mast On December 11, 1929, Al Smith released to the public that the Empire State Building would reach a towering 1,250 feet, the world's tallest building. To do this they were going to add a mooring mast to the top of the building to dock Dirigibles. The builders were unaware of the obstacles to come. They were faced with many architectural, logistical, and nature based dilemmas. When designing the mast, they realized they could not just place the mast on top. The wind pressure mixed with all the stress of the dirigible being held by one cable would send the stress throughout the building, and even down to the foundation (paragraph 1). To do this it would cost over millions of dollars to make the frame work strong enough to hold the stress. Another obstacle that came into play was safety. In the dirigibles hydrogen is used to fuel the dirigibles. Hydrogen is highly flammable so if anything ever happened over downtown New York. It would be a catastrophe. The greatest obstacle was said to be nature itself. The violent air currents are unpredictible and the dirigible would be shifting around even if weighted down. But it is not practical or safe to weigh the balloon down with pedestrians below. Overall the outcome of the mast was a fail due to the blindly seen and the blindly predicted obstacles of nature, architecture and logistics.
1208	16041	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In the reading they talk about how there is not much landing area in New York City, but, although adding space for landing, the height of the mast would be dangerous, not only for passengers but for those who were on ground level. Also, the thousand plus pound craft would add stress to the building's frame; so the frame would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the airship. -(Which would cost over a million dollars) the idea proved to be unsafe when the German dirigible Hindenburg blew up at a New Jersey airfield - they realized how dangerous that could be above densely populated area like New York City, thus leading to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan.
1209	16042	6	3	Based on the excerpt to The Mooring Mast, the builders who constructed the Empire State Building had faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building. One of many obstacles was nature itself. The winds that are on top of the building were always shifting, because of the violent air currents. If the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of it would swivel around & around the mooring mast, as said in paragraph @NUM1. Another obstacle was that the dirigibles from outside of the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium, & hydrogen is highly flammible. This posed a significant safety hazard, considering the potential for sparks or static electricity. As you can see there are quite a few of obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building had to face when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on this building.
1210	16043	6	3	"Based on the excerpt it is evident that the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the reasons for the ideas failure was the fact that there was already a law in place making it illegal for a dirigible to even approach the area, as it states in paragraph @NUM1. Also, it could've of been an extreme fire hazard if a blimp had ever reached the Empire State Building. This is proved in paragraph @NUM2, where it states, ""the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire..."" which caused the owners to realize, ""how much worse that accident could have been in New York."" On top of all this, weather proposed an even bigger problem. Violent air currents made the idea of a mooring mast was ""neither practical nor safe."" I believe the most important reason that the idea failed was because technology was simply advancing beyond predictions. In paragraph @NUM3, it says, ""Dirigibles instead of becoming the transportation of the future, had given way to airplanes."" Ultimately, a combination of legal restrictions, safety concerns highlighted by disasters like the Hindenburg, unpredictable weather conditions, and the rapid rise of airplane technology all contributed to the abandonment of the Empire State Building's dirigible docking ambitions."
1211	16044	6	3	"In the passage, The Mooring Mast, Marcia Amidon L¸sted discusses several adversities and obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of their many obstacles they faced, was ""the lack of a suitable landing area. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighed down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was niether practical nor safe."" However before thinking of landing dirigibles, architects had to figure out a way to get the mooring mast on top of the building. They ""could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof"" because ""the steel frame of the building would have to be modified and strengthened"" to support the structure's weight and the forces it would endure. Most of the problems were avoidable, except for that ""the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" making the entire endeavor exceptionally difficult and ultimately contributing to its failure."
1212	16045	6	3	"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the fact that most diribles from outside the United States used hydrogen in their blimps instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The builders of the Empire State building did not realize that this was a problem until on May 6, 1937, the German dirigible Hindenburg caught on fire in New Jersey (paragraph @NUM1). It was only then that they understood how bad matters would be if a dirigible caught fire right over the masses of people in New York. Another obstacle was nature. The winds on the top of the building were always violently changing, making the dirigible swivel around over the heads of the onlookers below (@LOCATION2). As stated in paragraph @NUM2, such a problem could be easily solved by weighting down the dirigible with lead weights. However, using lead weights that could accidentally fall on the people below was an unsafe way to keep the dirigible still. Lastly, as written in the beginning of paragraph @NUM3, there was an ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" By law, the whole idea of using the Empire State Building as a docking area for dirigibles was illegal, and rightfully so. There were too many complications, and one spark or strong breeze could jeopardize countless of lives. These reasons are why by the 1930s the plan to create a mooring mass for the dirigibles on the Empire State Building was dropped."
1213	16046	6	3	Governer Al Smith of New York had a vision. He wanted to have a building constructed that would surpass the current tallest building in the world, The Chrysler Building. He succeeded in doing so. The Empire State Building was now the tallest building in the world at 1,250 feet. But there were more plans for this building. At the time, aviation pioneers had dreamed of travel by dirigible, and now a mooring mast was to be built at the top of the building for docking these airships. But what should have been a cautious project, turned out to be a dangerous one. There should have been a lot more precaution going into this project. Dirigibles could be very dangerous in a widely populated area like New York City. The potential for disaster was significant, as these airships were filled with flammable hydrogen. If the dirigible were to catch fire and explode, people could get hurt. And at such a high altitude, it is likely. People were just starting to understand the dangers of this project halfway into it, which is why it was called off due to lack of safety, a realization that came perhaps too late in the process.
1214	16047	6	3	"The obstacles that the builder faced is making sure that the building was stable enough. The architects knew that they could not just drop a mooring mast on the Empire State Building. Al Smith commented and said that the mooring mask was on a okay level and how they were working on things. A set of engineers are working finding a workable and faster arrangements. While, the government is trying to find out a safe way for the mooring airships to mast. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame (@NUM1). The obstacles that the builders went through was if a big dirigible was to go on top of the building it was add stress by weighing it down. Also, it would get to the point where it would reach the frame of the building. They had to use a steel frame in order for things to work out. But, at the top of the building the winds cause violent shifting out to air currents. Having a dirigible dangling over pedestrians is very unsafe or even good. The immense weight and the strain from the mooring cable would test the building's structural integrity. Furthermore, the unpredictable wind conditions at that height posed a considerable risk, potentially causing the dirigible to sway dangerously. The builder of the Empire State building faced many significant challenges to allow the dirigibles to dock there, highlighting the complexities of integrating such an ambitious concept with practical engineering and safety considerations."
1215	16048	6	3	"The Empire State Building was always very famous and well-known, but did want more attention. Governor of New York, Al Smith, tried to allow dirigibles to dock on the building for transportation. He was encouraged it would work and actually went through with building it. The builders went through many obstacles trying to make it possible. To make this dream possible the builders would have to modify and strengthen the building, adding structural supports. This would not be cheap, ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" It would be very expensive, especially during the Depression. The builders designed a ""shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower."" Also the mast would have four wings of all all corners. The builders designed observation areas and even elevators and baggage areas to accommodate passengers. They had it all planned out and raised an American flag at the top in anticipation. Unfortunately, nobody considered all the dangers of docking dirigibles, such as high winds and the difficulty of maneuvering such large aircraft in a crowded urban environment. All the builders work never went through. They tried to dock two but it did not work out due to the strong updrafts. The building instead turned into the world's highest soda fountain and tea garden for sightseers, a successful tourist attraction."
1216	16049	6	3	When building the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, the architects experienced many obstacles. These obstacles led the designers to never effectively use the mooring mast like they had hoped to. The first problem they had, was that a thousand ton dirigible would add stress to the buildings frame. The designers had to spend a considerable amount of money to reinforce the building's frameworks. This first obstacle already put doubt into the builders minds, that this was not going to happen easily. The next thing they realized, was that with hydrogen dirigibles is that they were extremely flamable. If a huge dirigible were to catch fire and fall onto New York City it would be cataustrophic. This also leasoned their enthusiasm about the work, knowing about how great a risk this would be. The wind above the building were constantly Shifting due to air currents, and this would toss and turn the dirigible tethered to the mast. The designers relized this would be neither practical or safe being over pedestrians on the ground. The last obstacle of all, that really killed their mooring idea, was airship laws. The law states that the dirigibles cannot fly that low over urban areas, so that puts an illegal mark on their plans. The designers of the mooring mast had to face many obstacles in their design, and it was these obstacles that led to the never useing of their mast.
1217	16050	6	3	"There were many obstacles that the architects never realized while building the docking station for the dirigibles. One of these obstacles they faced was height, and the lack of safety that arose from it. In @DATE1, the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"", which used highly flammable hydrogen, caught fire in New Jersey as described in paragraph thirteen. Should this have happened to a dirigible docked high over New York City, the airship would plummet to the ground where many New @CAPS1 would be going about their day. The largest obstacle they faced though was nature. Air currents and storms would cause the dirigible, only tethered to the mooring mast by a rope, to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast... dangling high above pedestrians on the street."" As pointed out in paragraph fourteen, this was neither practical, nor safe. The third obstacle they faced was a pre-existing law against airships flying too low over urbanized areas. Even as tall as the Empire State Building is, it was still impossible to legally dock at the new mooring mast. Al Smith's idea finally had to be abandoned due to safety concerns, the unpredictability of nature, and restrictive state laws."
1218	16051	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the weight of the dirigible, or blimp, and wind pressure, which caused too much stress on the building's frame. The architects easily overcame this obstacle by strengthening the iron frame of the building so it could withstand the added stress. Unfortunately, the other obstacles were not overcome, and led to the abandonment of the use of the mast for docking dirigibles. The biggest problem was safety. Many blimps used hydrogen rather than helium to keep it afloat, which is highly flammable, posing too much of a risk of the blimp catching fire and falling onto the city. Nature was also an enormous obstacle, as wind would blow the blimp into surrounding buildings, and, floating in the air, weights couldn't keep it down. Finally, an existing law prohibited aircraft from flying too low around urban areas, further complicating the docking procedure. These combined issues ultimately proved insurmountable, rendering the dirigible docking plan impractical and unsafe.
1219	16052	6	3	The problems that were faced was that the ships could get blown by the wind and hit buildings. Then they thought of putting weights on the ships to stabilize them, but then they worried the weights could fall off and hit people on the ground, creating a new hazard.
1220	16053	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, many obstacles were described that got in the way of allowing dirigibles to dock on The Empire State Building. One obstacle was that the Empire State Building had a flat roof and the framework of the building would have to be made stronger to put the mooring mast on there. The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" It cost more than $500,000 to modify the framework. Another obstacle was the law. ""flying to low over urban areas"" was illegal, so it would be impossible for a dirigible to even go near the Empire State Building. Lastly, the biggest obstacle was safety. Blimps that were being flown around New York were made using hydrogen, which is flammable. Also, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" It wouldn't be safe to hook a blimp up in those winds where it would be shifting all around. Of course, it was also a safety hazard because thousands of pedestrians would be walking on the road below, ""Where [the dirigibles] would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street,"" it would be terrible if one fell. It should have been obvious that hooking dirigibles to a mast on the Empire State Building was not going to work."
1221	16054	6	3	"On the excerpt there were a lot of obstacles on the attempt of building the Empire State Building and making it safe to dock dirigibles. The first obstacle to building the Empire State building was that the engineer Al Smith wanted to make the Empire State building, ""the world's tallest building."" ""When the Empire State building was conceived, it was planned as the world's tallest building, taller even than the new Chrysler building that was being constructed."" Al Smith wanted to surpass the Chrysler building, which was already aiming for great heights. The problem was that the architect of the Chrysler Building put a 185 ft spire inside the building. Al Smith got an idea that would make the Empire State Building taller and better. His idea would be more than an ""ornament"" ""their top, the said, would serve a higher calling. The Empire State building would be equipped for an age of transportation that was then only the dream of aviation pioneers."" He believed that he could use the building as a dock for dirigibles, so people could get on and off. The problem was that that the frame would not work. ""The mooring mast of the Empire State building was destined to never fulfill its purpose."" They attempted to land dirigibles two times but they weren't able to do it in the end. ""In December 1930, the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough."" The strong winds at that height made docking incredibly dangerous and impractical. They could not fix the problem, and the dirigible docking idea was eventually abandoned, highlighting the challenges of pushing the boundaries of engineering and aviation at the time."
1222	16055	6	3	"The Empire State Building started out as a huge sky-scraper. Then Al Smith had to get all competitive and put his crew to full work. The crew had many obsticles to fufil. First off, they had to modify and strengthen the building's steel frame, costing over sixty thousand dollars. Second the men made a shiny glass and chrome-nickle stainless steel tower, illuminated inside. Next they had to add four wings or shiny aluminum to rise a conical roof for housing the mooring arm. Fourth the crew has to add stairs and elevators to accommodate the ""blimps"" passengers. And lastly they would add a couple of observation rooms to the 86 and 102 floors. Smith's men worked hard and over came many obsticles attempting to allow dirigibles to dock the Empire State Building, though ultimately, this ambitious plan proved impractical and was abandoned shortly after its implementation."
1223	16056	6	3	"Architects and builders faced several obstacles when attempting to build the Empire State Building and allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle they faced was keeping a safe environment. Dirigibles that are fueled by hydrogen are prone to be destroyed by fire. One example of this is in paragraph @NUM1, ""the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey."" Another major obstacle was high wind speeds and violent air currents. These made docking dangerous because the back of the ship would be swung around the mooring mast. Lastly, another obstacle that they faced was a law. In paragraph @NUM2, it says, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law would keep dirigibles from being able to ever dock there or even fly in the general area. All of these obstacles could not be overcome, so in the end, the mooring mast was not successful."
1224	16057	6	3	"There were a lot of obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For instance, they wanted to add more height to the Empire State Building so it can be, ""equipped for an age of transportation that was then only the dream of aviation dream,"" @PERSON1 said. Next, Al Smith wanted to add a mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building so it could allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on. ""Over sixty thousand dollar's worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework,"" to accommodate this ambitious plan. Then they, ""designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself,"" ensuring it was both functional and aesthetically pleasing. Also, ""the rocket-shaped mast would have four wings at its corners, of shiny aluminum, and would rise to a conical roof that would house the mooring arms."" The roof had to be completed before the mast installation could take place, adding a logistical challenge to the construction. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast, however, was nature itself, with unpredictable winds making docking dangerous. In conclusion, those were the significant obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in their ultimately unrealized attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there."
1225	16058	6	3	"It is within our obligations as human beings to have dreams and want to convert them into reality. Al Smith's dream of having dirigibles land on the Empire State Building is one I'd consider to be rather erratic. There were many obstacles that proved from early on, the fate of this project was failure. It is apparent from very early into the construction that this was surreal because ""the one obstacle to their expanded life in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area"" (paragraph 6). Having dirigibles cruising through a large city should have been perceivably impossible to Al Smith, even before the construction of the building occurred, given the density of the city and the unpredictable weather patterns. Safety was also something to be seriously taken into consideration since ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" which also intertwined with the laws of objects flying too low over an urban area (paragraph 1). These factors, coupled with the sheer impracticality, made Smith's vision an unrealistic ambition doomed to fail."
1226	16059	6	3	"The first obstacle was to ensure the Empire State Building became the world's tallest building, achieved by adding a distinctive Art Deco spire, often referred to as a ""hat,"" to surpass the Chrysler Building in height. And the second obstacle involved a failed experiment: the original design included a mooring mast intended for dirigibles, with the impractical and dangerous idea of passengers disembarking via a gangplank to the building's flat roof, quickly proving unfeasible. These challenges highlight the ambition and ultimately, the limitations, of the building's early vision."
1227	16060	6	3	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building were quite apparent. One obstacle was that of nature; winds atop the building were at high speeds and always changing, this would make the dirigible unstable and difficult to dock, especially considering the massive size of these airships. Another obstacle they faced was that of the passengers' and bystanders' safety; the dirigible could become uncontrollable, putting many lives in danger both on the ground and aboard the airship itself. The last obstacle the builders faced was that of a law against flying airships too low over urban areas, it would make it illegal for a dirigible to dock on the Empire State Building, as the docking procedure would necessitate a prohibited low altitude flight. The many obstacles that the builders faced blocked the completion of having a dirigible dock atop the Empire State Building.
1228	16061	6	3	The obstacles the builders would have to face would be things such as structural integrity, and worrying about future technological advances. Even if they found out how to land a dirigible on the platform, what about advances on them or new transportation methods? The structural integrity was a quick fix, by reinforcing the supports to the building itself. Addressing these concerns allowed the project to proceed with a firmer foundation for future adaptations.
1229	16062	6	3	"There were many obstacles faced by the builders in the creation of the mast. One obstacle was the building's flat roof. A dirigible that was moored to the building by a single cable, would cause the building's frame to be stressed. Due to this the builders had to modify and strengthen the frame to solve this obstacle. Another problem was that other countries still used hydrogen and an explosion over New York would be devastating, leading to safety concerns. One of the greatest obstacles was ""nature itself."" Winds at the top were constantly changing, making it difficult to control the airship. The back of the ship would move around the mooring mast. They had to solve this in a safe manner. In fields the back of a dirigible would be weighed down by lead, but this could not be done on a building. It would be unsafe to allow the lead to dangle over civilians' heads. On top of all these obstacles, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which further complicated the landing process. In the end the mooring mast was a failure because not all these obstacles could be solved and fixed, demonstrating the complex challenges inherent in early airship technology."
1230	16063	6	3	The first obstical came when the Chrysler builing had changed its height. They created the mooring mast and made the empire state builbing 200 ft. higher. Then they figured out that the mast would add stress to the buildings frame. Then with the new laws and the hindenburg that the mooring mast would not work-out. So they gave up trying to make it useful, ultimately concluding that the structural and legal challenges were insurmountable.
1231	16064	6	3	"First, there was no way to anchor any dirigibles. They couldn't make the back stable, only if they added lead weights; that wasn't a good idea above a crowded street given the potential for disaster if those weights were to fall. Second, there were laws in place stating that a dirigible couldn't fly that close to buildings, further complicating any potential docking attempts. Also, when the German blimp Hindenburg was destroyed by fire near a New Jersey naval base, people thought ""... how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" @CAPS1, the wind that high up was too fierce and strong for a blimp to even get close to the building, making maneuvering incredibly dangerous. All in all it was a bad idea, considering the many safety and practical obstacles."
1232	16065	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle that was faced was the building's foundation. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure will have to be transmitted, nearly eleven hundred feet below."" This became an obstacle because the building had already been built, so they'd have to work around the existing foundation, adding reinforcements without disrupting the structure. Another obstacle that was faced was a law. The law stated ""no airships are allowed to fly low over urban areas."" This became an obstacle because they had to convince government people it was safe, requiring demonstrations and assurances. Finally the greatest obstacle was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This was an obstacle because winds could get so bad that the dirigible tied up could rip the roof off and hurt the people below, posing a significant safety risk. In conclusion, that is how the builders in the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building."
1233	16066	6	3	The task of allowing dirigibles to dock on The Empire State Building was met with many obstacles. The first one to come into play was the support of the building. The dirigible's load and the wind pressure would greatly reduce the stability of the building. Over sixty thousand dollars went into modifications of the building's framework to reinforce it. Another problem was the dirigibles themselves. Most dirigibles coming from outside of the United States were filled with hydrogen, a lighter-than-air gas used for buoyancy. As seen in the tragic Hindenburg incident, hydrogen is highly flammable. The owners of the Empire State Building concluded that an accident such as this would be even more devastating over a densely populated area like New York City. After being faced with all these obstacles, the idea of dirigibles docking atop the Empire State Building was put to rest for the safety of the people.
1234	16067	6	3	When constructing the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, it seemed as if the engineers looked past all of its flaws. Safety was probably one of the biggest issues for the mooring mast, given the volatile nature of airships. It was said most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium, thus causing a higher risk to explode. After the events of the Hindenburg in Lakehurst, New Jersey, they were very afraid of what would happen if a similar disaster occurred above downtown Manhattan. Nature was believed to be its biggest obstacle. Winds at the top of the air always shifted violently due to air currents, posing a threat to the massive airships. The back of the ships would swivel around and around the mooring mast. Legal restrictions were another major reason the plan was flawed. Dirigibles were not allowed to fly a certain height over urban areas, making it illegal to even approach the area where the building was. Al Smith really should have done some more studying about what could have gone wrong with his mooring mast, as multiple factors contributed to its impracticality.
1235	16068	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous technical and safety problems in creating the building's dirigible mooring mast. First off, a dirigible moored to the mast by just one cable would put enormous stress to the frame of the building, potentially compromising its structural integrity. The building's frame had to be strengthened first to allow such a project, adding to the construction's complexity and cost. When the mast was finished, several other problems prevented its use. The mast was designed to make the building a center of travel, but most dirigibles from other countries used hydrogen to fly, instead of helium, which was much safer but more expensive. Earlier, the German blimp Hindenburg had been destroyed because hydrogen was so flammable, vividly demonstrating the danger. It was realized that such a disaster would be much more catastrophic should it happen over a densely populated city like New York, with potentially devastating consequences. Also, blimps moored to the mast would be blown around by violent winds, possibly pushing them into nearby buildings, creating a hazard to surrounding structures. The lead weights normally used to prevent this would have had to be left dangling over pedestrians, a major safety issue, posing a direct risk to those below. Furthermore, there was a law prohibiting dirigibles from flying too low over urban settlements, making use of the mast illegal under existing regulations. These problems doomed the mooring mast project from the start, rendering it ultimately impractical and unsafe.
1236	16069	6	3	The fact that these dirigibles are so big and filled with hydrogen and helium meant that any sharp point at the top of a building would have posed a puncture risk. Also, the winds were frequently too high, making it nearly impossible to safely connect the blimp to the building's mooring mast. Lastly, the memory of the German dirigible, Hindenburg, and how it burned so catastrophically, fueled fears of a similar disaster. Especially in a densely populated area such as New York, such a fire would have been devastating.
1237	16070	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building were faced with many problems when attempting to make a mooring mast for Dirigibles. The first major problem they came across was the building itself. It said ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" The building, being the tallest in the world, could not take the pressure. They could possibly have made it stronger but at high cost to something so already substantial. The architects' next obstacle was safety, especially in a highly populated area such as downtown New York. They found the Dirigibles to be too dangerous and uncontrollable in a city of towers. The normal processes of docking a Dirigible would have to completely change to accommodate the mooring mast; soon, laws were given to have airships stay away from areas of population after the Hindenburg incident. Yet some still dared to try and dock at the mast, such as the Los Angeles and Columbia, but the mast was never put to good use and shows the problems with innovating things already established, as the Empire State Building ultimately was."
1238	16071	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a lot of obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. A big problem was safety: most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Another reason was when dirigibles moored in open landing fields, they could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building would not work out due to the highly populated New York and the potential for weights dangling over pedestrians. Another reason was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. Even if it could, there were worries that the dirigible would be punctured by other obstacles on surrounding buildings, making the entire endeavor simply too risky. Ultimately, these various safety and legal concerns made the dirigible docking plan impractical.
1239	16072	6	3	"Architects and builders working on building a docking platform on top of the Empire State Building for dirigibles faced many obstacles. The first problem builders came across was the possibility that the building's framework was not potentially strong enough to support a dirigible's weight. It was said in paragraph nine that ""the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way down to the building's foundation, and that was too risky. Another obstacle that builder's came across ""was nature itself."" Because some dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, it was feared that the winds on top of the building would be too intensely violent and any spark could ignite the flammable gas. The next obstacle builders faced was public safety. There was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Therefore, dirigibles could not approach the dock over the area for sake of the citizens of New York. All of these problems eventually led to ""the idea of using the mooring mast [to be] shelved,"" effectively ending the ambitious plan."
1240	16073	6	3	After reading the excerpt, there were many obstacles the builders faced in attempting to dock dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building. Firstly, the lack of a suitable landing area was a primary concern. The builders knew they had to add a mooring mast to the top of it so it could safely land and passengers could board and exit. Another problem they faced was placing a thousand-foot dirigible at the top of the building, which would add stress to the building's frame, potentially compromising its structural integrity. This pressure, along with the wind pressure, would have to be converted all the way to the building's foundation to ensure stability. Lastly, the biggest obstacle was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting because of violent air currents, allowing the back of the ship to swivel uncontrollably around the mooring mast. Although it was a bright idea to improve transportation and connectivity, this product never worked in practice and, ultimately, was not thought out properly, proving the challenges were insurmountable.
1241	16074	6	3	Based on the excerpt given, the idea for allowing dirigibles to land on a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building in New York City was not practical. One obstacle that proves this point is that most dirigibles are filled with hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, rather than helium like a balloon. This raises significant safety issues for the densely populated urban city. Another obstacle that prevented this idea from being practical was that certain laws were passed stating that dirigibles and airships could only fly so low over urban areas due to violent, unpredictable winds and the risk of destruction. Ultimately, the mooring mast was and isn't practical for the landing of airships and is mainly useful for its iconic status as a tourist attraction.
1242	16075	6	3	"The architects of the Empire State building faced several obstacles when constructing the mooring mast. One of which would be that the purpose which it was suppose to serve (docking dirigibles), the original design of the building could not handle it. In paragraph @NUM1, it says ""A thousand foot dirigibles would add stress to the buildings frame."" Because of this realization, they had to make ""sixty-thousand dollars worth of modifications"" (paragraph @NUM1). Another obstacle they would have to face would be the additions of new floors. They originlly designed the building to be about @NUM3 floors, but with the addition of the mooring mast, the builders had to make an extra top and do it with such detail so that it could be both an observatory and a boarding dock. These first two obstacles, although they were difficult, nevertheless they were solvable. Some of the obstacles the builders had to face were not fixable. The first was that dirigible's from @LOCATION2 were filled with hydrogen (which is highly flamable). Due to the location of the Empire State building (downtown New York), a little accident could cause huge problems in the city. Also, they did not take in consideration the winds at the top of the building. The Empire State building would be at such a high altitude that there would be very high winds. These winds would cause for the dirigibles to be unstable which was also not safe. With these last two obstacles, the mooring mast was still built, but served as a design instead of a dock, illustrating how practical concerns ultimately outweighed the initial ambition."
1243	16076	6	3	"In the excerpt the obstacles the BUILDERS of the Empire State Building face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the ""lack of a suitable landing area"". (p. @NUM1) BUILDERS were trying to attempt a suitable landing area to allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and let passengers off and on. BUILDERS try to attempt an electric winch. This ""would swing in the breeze and yet passengers could safely get on and off the dirigible by walking gangplank to an open observation platform."" The biggest obstacle, BUILDERS of the Empire State building was to ""nature itself"" which meant that dirigibles moored in open landing fields, where they would be high above pedestrians on the street where it was neither practical nor safe. BUILDERS of the Empire State attempted these causes to allow dirigibles to enter on the property of the Empire State Building! Therefore, the builders of the Empire State Building attempted innovative solutions to overcome the practical and environmental challenges, ultimately aiming to make dirigible docking a reality."
1244	16077	6	3	"In this excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced. The safety of the people were at stake, nature was also a great obstacle, the other reason was that dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State building because it was against the law. First of all, the builders obstacle that they completely forgot about was the safety of the people. Most of the blimps from outside of the @LOCATION2 used hydrogen other than helium, and hydrogen is very flammable. And they did not want to risk anyone getting hurt in a densely populated area. Also, another big obstacle was @CAPS1 nature itself. At times the winds would be violent and it would go back and forth. And if a blimp was attached, it would be dangling violently over citizens had not nearly safe. Lastly, it was illegal to have airships flying close to urban areas and New York was highly dense. And the reason for this law is for nothing bad to happen to the citizens. In conclusion, there were many obstacles the builders had gone through, and they were blinded by the project and they wanted to get it done they forgot about safety."
1245	16078	6	3	There would have been multiple obstacles when allowing dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building. One, the area may get very densely populated with taller buildings, hindering approach. Since they had never made one before, the docking mechanism itself could malfunction. And last, like the Hindenburg, another disaster like that could happen, but this time in a densely populated city, leading to catastrophic loss of life and widespread panic, ultimately making the entire endeavor far too risky.
1246	16079	6	3	"While building the Empire State Building, builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the greatest obstacles was safety. They would need to find a way to dock the dirigibles to the mast with out having it swing in the wind. ""Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (@NUM1). This uncontrolled movement posed a significant risk to both the airship and the building itself. Another obstacle in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock the Empire State Building was designing the mast. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof"" (@NUM2). The stability of the entire structure was paramount, so the Empire State Building's steel frame had to be strengthened in order to withstand the weight of the mast and the forces exerted by a docked dirigible. These engineering challenges ultimately proved too difficult to overcome practically."
1247	16080	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in the making of the mast. The first obstacle was that of the building's stability. The excerpt states ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened"". This shows that in order for the mast to even be built, the structure of the entire building would need to be altered to accommodate the use of the mast, requiring significant engineering adjustments. The second obstacle they faced, in the actual use of the mast, was nature. In hopes of docking the dirigibles to the mast, mother nature would not allow it, as it states in the excerpt, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" They also warned that with those air currents the passengers would not make it off of the dirigible safely due to the end of the dirigible floating rapidly undocked, and the swaying motion would prove far too dangerous. They feared that if they docked the end it would be unsafe to the pedestrians below just as the helium in the dirigible would have as well, making the entire endeavor impractical and ultimately leading to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan. Thus, both structural limitations and the unpredictable forces of nature conspired to thwart the original ambitious vision for the mast."
1248	16081	6	3	"The builders faced several obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the mast of the Empire State Building, until finally they called it quits. According to the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the Chrysler building in New York City was about to be surpassed by the not-yet-built Empire State. The weight and strength of a dirigible could damage the entire building so it would have to be strengthened and modified in order for the blimp to be able to land. The engineers also had to find a way to control the flammability that dirigibles tend to have, a significant concern given the hydrogen they often used. In paragraph @NUM1, L¸sted describes a dirigible that exploded in New Jersey not long ago, and that constructing a landing pad over the densely populated New York City, could be detrimental. The constructors of the mooring mast finally came to the conclusion that the plan was ""neither practical nor safe"" (@NUM2). The blimps are held down with lead weights and this could have a negative effect on pedestrians if something were to ever go wrong, posing a safety hazard to those below. The builders of the Empire State building had a lot to think about in regards to constructing the dirigible dock, and in the end, considering all the potential dangers and structural challenges, it was for the better that they decided against it."
1249	16082	6	3	"In the excerpt from, ""The Mooring Mast"", the author, Marcia Amidon L¸sted, explains how the spire of the Empire State Building was originally meant to be used as a mooring mast. This purpose of the spire was never to be fulfilled because of the numerous problems and obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some of the biggest problems that the builders faced were unpredictable and violent winds, the use of hydrogen in dirigibles, and air laws. The winds posed to be a problem because even though the front of the dirigible would be tethered to the mast belonged back side would be allowed to swing freely in the wind which could cause it to crash into another moored dirigible. The winds also would make just getting to the Empire State Building a hazardous job for the airships and their passengers. The use of hydrogen was a problem because hydrogen is a volatile gas in the sense that it explodes, which would be very dangerous over a densely populated area like Manhattan, thus making the prospect of mooring dirigibles there quite risky. Lastly, the air laws were a problem because the United States has a law that prohibits airships from flying too low over urban areas, which would make a mooring at the Empire State Building illegal, and thus impractical."
1250	16083	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles such as the use of hydrogen, air currents, and existing laws, in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the building. The first obstacle the builders had encountered was the use of hydrogen in most dirigibles outside the United States. Hydrogen is considered highly flammable, a big safety issue. A German dirigible was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. ""The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as down town New York."" (@NUM1) If this had occurred in New York the damage could of been a lot worse. Another obstacle the builders faced was the violent air currents. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" (@NUM1) this is very dangerous because of pedestrians on the street. The final obstacle was an already existing law that prohibits airships flying low over urban areas. ""The law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to a building."" (@NUM3) this law would not allow dirigible to approach New York. In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the owners of the Empire State Building faced obstacles such as the use of hydrogen, air currents and existing laws in attempting to allow dirigible dock at the building. Ultimately, these challenges, from flammability concerns to turbulent winds and legal restrictions, proved too significant to overcome, rendering the mooring mast concept impractical."
1251	16084	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was that the stress of the dirigibles load and wind pressure could have caused problems to the buildings foundation. A thousand-foot dirigible, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame. Safety was another issue; most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen, instead of helium. This is a problem because hydrogen is highly flammable. On May 6, 1937, the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in New Jersey; the accident would have been more dangerous in New York because the city is densely populated. Another reason why they faced problems to allow dirigibles to dock is because there was an existing law against airships flying too close over urban areas. In December 1930, the U.S. Navy dirigible did attempt to reach the mooring mast but could not reach because of the winds, fearing that it may blow the dirigible onto sharp spires of other buildings, which would puncture the dirigibles shell, ultimately making the endeavor impractical and unsafe.
1252	16085	6	3	"Without a doubt, the builders of the mooring mast that was to rest at the top of the Empire State Building were highly innovative and ambitious. However, it is also clear that they faced many difficulties that they both overcame and were overcome by. One major difficulty that they faced was that a one thousand foot long dirigible being tethered to a 1,250 foot tall building with extreme wind currents around the top would put a great deal of stress onto the building, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation... Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework."" To mitigate this, the builders reinforced the building's steel skeleton, showcasing their ingenuity. After the building however, the mooring mast was not able to be used for it's full purpose because of more challenges that it faced. After the tragic accident with the Hindenburg, ""the owners realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a density populated area such as downtown New York."" Another concern was that with such strong winds and only being able to tie the front of the dirigible to the moor, the back would swing around. ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical or safe."" The final challenge facing the mooring mast was the prexisting law against low-flying aircraft. Ultimately, these combined challenges proved insurmountable, hindering the initial vision and unfortunately putting an end to Al Smith's dreams."
1253	16086	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, the builder of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, primarily concerning safety and practicality. My prediction is that the height of the Empire State Building poses a significant challenge, making mooring blimps precarious. Al Smith's concern seems rooted in the inherent risks of maneuvering airships at such a height. This fear of a potential accident is likely what is worrying Al Smith. My backup answer stems from the statement, ""it's on the level, all right. ""No kidding"". We're on the thing now. One set of engineers here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement and the Government people in Washington are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast."" This reveals a sense of uncertainty and ongoing experimentation. The builders are actively trying to find a workable, safe method, indicating that a solution is not readily available, and the practical challenges associated with mooring airships to the mast are still being worked out, suggesting the complexities and potential problems inherent in the endeavor."
1254	16087	6	3	There were many obstacles builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle they faced was that some dirigibles were 800 feet long which was four blocks in New York City. This was an obstacle because it would add stress to the buildings' frame when it was attached by single tether. In order for this to happen the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be strengthened and modified. The next obstacle they faced was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. For example, in the excerpt it said that the U.S. navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of the forceful winds. Also the captain could not even take his hands off the lever. The next obstacle they faced was the safety issue. The builders of said the dirigibles are weighted down by lead but if they did that it would be a safety issue. It would be a safety issue since the dirigible would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street. The last obstacle they faced was the law against flying to low over urban areas, which meant it would be illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even approach the area, thereby rendering the entire docking concept impractical.
1255	16088	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on its mooring mast. The first obstacle they had was the extreme winds, particularly at that height. The winds were constantly shifting, so the dirigibles would be violently blowing through the air, making docking dangerous. Another obstacle was that the foreign dirigibles used hydrogen, instead of helium, which is extremely flammable and posed a significant safety risk in a densely populated area. The last obstacle the builders faced was the law that it did not allow airships to fly too low over urban areas, further complicating any potential docking procedures. The builders of the Empire State Building dealt with a number of reasons when they attempted to dock dirigibles on the building's mast, ultimately making the plan impractical and unsafe.
1256	16089	6	3	Many obstacles were confronted when attempting to dock dirigibles on the Empire State Building. Such as the danger of non-U.S. dirigibles docking, particularly because they used hydrogen instead of helium, making them highly flammable. They thought about the Hindenburg disaster and realized how much worse such an event would be if it happened in the heart of downtown New York. Another issue was nature's wind force. The wind on top of the Empire State Building was aggressively shifting, making it difficult to control the large airships. Plus, using lead weights for mooring, a common practice when landing in open fields, would pose a significant hazard to the people below. Finally, the law presented a hurdle. Regulations stated that it was illegal to fly this low over urban areas. Although two dirigibles attempted to dock, they both experienced firsthand the inherent dangers, ultimately proving the impracticality of the endeavor.
1257	16090	6	3	"Based on the expert, builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Allowing a dirigible to dock on top of the Empire State Building was never thought of as an easy task to accomplish. As it was mentioned in the article, the idea of the dirigible was ""destined to never fulfill its purposes."" One obstacle in which builders would face is safety. Since most of the dirigibles from outside the U.S.A use hydrogen rather than helium, hydrogen is much more flammable. This posed a very dangerous obstacle to builders because fire itself is really dangerous and could have disastrous consequences at such a height. The greatest obstacle was nature itself, however. If the winds are shifting violently, the dirigibles could be way off course and be dangling high above the pedestrians. This would not be safe for the people or the builders because it could hurt them, potentially causing serious injuries or fatalities. Another obstacle builders would face is that there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. It would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up or get close to the area. This made it harder for builders to accomplish because it's against the law, creating a significant legal hurdle. Ultimately, these challenges, ranging from safety concerns to legal restrictions and the unpredictable nature of weather conditions, proved insurmountable, leading to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan."
1258	16091	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State building were faced with in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. There were obstacles such as the fact that if a dirigible were tied to the building by a single tether it would ""add stress to the building's frame."" To fix the problem, over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building, including reinforcing the structure. Another problem was that some dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable which would be very dangerous to have over a densely populated area, posing a significant fire hazard. The ""greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" By this, L¸sted means that there are many violent air currents at the top of the building, meaning that the ship would swivel around and around. To make sure this would not happen, lead wieghts would have to be used which would not be practical or safe to have ""dangling high above pedestrians."" Ultimately, the complexity and potential danger outweighed the benefits. In the end, people realized there were far too many problems involved in the use of a mooring mast at the top of the Empire State building, rendering the ambitious idea impractical."
1259	16092	6	3	"To start off, the builders of the Empire State Building had faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Many of the obstacles had delt with the dirigible itself. For example, the dirigible was highly unsafe and flammable by the 1930s. ""When the German dirigible was destroyed by fire, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937 realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area, such as downtown New York."" This disaster highlighted the significant risks associated with lighter-than-air travel. Another obstacle that the builders had faced was nature itself. The winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. It would be highley dangerous for a dirigible to fly that close to a mooring mast with winds like that. Also, dirigibles could not fly near the Empire State Building, due to an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or approach the area. Al Smith's dream was to make the Empire State Building suitable for transportation, but sometimes dreams don't always go threw, and in this case, the practical realities and safety concerns ultimately grounded the ambitious plan."
1260	16093	6	3	The experts faced a few major obstacles in the building of the Empire State Building. One of those major obstacles was the framework. When you're going to build a 1,250-foot building and have an aircraft land on it, you need a good and well-designed frame. They used steel beams and reinforced concrete to create a strong and stable skeleton, adding stainless steel and chrome-nickel windows to cut down on pressure. They spent over sixty thousand dollars on modifications to the skeleton of the Empire State Building to ensure its structural integrity. The other main issue was the air currents. You cannot strap a dirigible and believe the back of it won't sway back and forth. When you're almost 1,250 feet in the air, the wind can be very violent at that height. If the dirigible ever came off or unhooked before they were done refueling, the dirigible would crash and burn, endangering hundreds of pedestrians on the ground below. Al Smith had a great idea, but he did not realize all the problems inherent in mooring an airship to such a tall structure, especially considering the unpredictable wind conditions.
1261	16094	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. They had to consider the stress of the building, and adding more to the top of the building would increase the stress. The steel frame would have to be modified and strengthened to meet the needs, which would also add to the weight. Also it would be over $5 million worth of modifications. The builders also faced the obstacle of safety. Most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is flammable, so it wouldn't be safe for passengers or the building itself. There was also ""... an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" that would be difficult to overcome. Facing all these obstacles, caused the builders to not go through with this idea, as the practical challenges and safety concerns proved too significant."
1262	16095	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One main concern was the dirigibles themselves because they use hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is very flammable. If a dirigible were to explode above a densely populated area it would be disastrous. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the building's mooring mast was nature. A mooring mast is used for docking airships such as a dirigible or a zeppelin. With these large air crafts, docking them on top of a building where winds are violently shifting is very dangerous; wind sheer was a consistent issue. The back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast, posing as a significant threat. Dirigibles moored in open land fields where they could be weighed down with lead weights. With a dirigible moored over the Empire State Building, it would dangle high above pedestrians, this is neither safe nor practical. Constructing the Empire State Building had even more challenges and obstacles than its architects would have hoped for.
1263	16096	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building had various problems to **overcome** in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The nature of the ships, added stress to the building and safety were all against the ludicrous idea of landing blimps on the Empire State Building. The nature of the ships would cause the body to sway in the wind. One problem that comes from this is tangling the mooring cable. To combat this captains would have to use lead counterweights. These were highly impractical to use because they would hanging over crowded streets. Another problem was added stress to the buildings Foundation. Since the building was not ordinarily designed for this role, modifications would have to be made to its foundation. The cost of these renovations was over sixty thousand dollars. The most obvious problem was safety. These airships were filled with highly flammable hydrogen. The area surrounding the building had other buildings with sharp spires on top. If a ship hit one of these, there was no stopping the disaster. Ultimately, the combination of impractical solutions, structural concerns, and immense safety risks made the dirigible docking plan unfeasible, leading to its abandonment.
1264	16097	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. These obstacles include the weather, safety, previous dirigible tragedy, and the law. The wind at the top of the Empire State building was a huge safety hazard because even if the dirigible was secured, the back would swing and cause a potential hazard due to the unpredictable winds. To fly a dirigible they are filled with hydrogen instead of helium; this is also dangerous because hydrogen is very flammable. On May 6, 1937, the Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, so the owners took into consideration this could have been much worse if the accident had taken place above a densely populated area such as New York. Dirigibles are very unsafe, so this created many obstacles for the builders of the Empire State Building to allow dirigibles to dock there, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the mooring mast concept due to the convergence of these significant safety and practical concerns.
1265	16098	6	3	The obstacles that the builders faced included flying blimps too low in the area and the initial plan making the Empire State Building not tall enough to secure the title of world's tallest. Like in Al Smith realized that he's in danger of losing his title for world's tallest building. On December 11, 1929, he announced that the Empire State building would reach a height of 1,250 ft. All he had to do is add a top or a hat to the building and that would make it even taller than any other building in the city. Another obstacle they faced was a law about airships flying too low above urban areas. They made this law so no airship would ever tie up with a building. Flying too low is a huge safety hazard; it could take the lives of hundreds of people, so the building plans had to account for this air traffic. Thus, the height and airship regulations were significant considerations for the project.
1266	16099	6	3	In the excerpt there were multiple obstacles the builders faced when allowing dirigibles to dock on the empire state building. First was making the steel frame of the building stronger to withstand the immense forces exerted by docking airships. The builders also had to make the empire state building 102 stories tall, and make the 101st story an observatory, adding complexity to the structural design. The last obstacle the faced was building the empire state building itself, a monumental task involving complex logistics and engineering challenges. Those are the obstacles that the builders faced when construction the empire state building.
1267	16100	6	3	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted there were many obstacles that builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the problems was that a huge dirigible held to the top of the building held by a single cable would have stressed to the rest of the building. In order to make the tower half of the building more stable they would have to spend sixty thousand dollars on modifications. Nature was a key issue; the winds were unpredictable because of violent air currents, and even if the dirigibles were tied to the mast, the back would swivel around. Large dirigibles dangling above pedestrians was not safe, due to possible equipment failures or unpredictable weather. Another reason as to why dirigibles could not be docked at the top of the Empire State Building was because there was a law not allowing airships to fly so low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal to ever dock ships there, effectively grounding the entire concept. Overall, these were some of the obstacles faced while building the Empire State Building, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan.
1268	16101	6	3	"Coming from ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon A¸sted, the Empire State building was to be so much more. The hazards of the gases in some of the Dirigibles was a huge risk because some were flammable. The hydrogen used in some airships posed a significant fire hazard. Having the mooring mast in the huge city served potential threats to the safety of the city and population as well. As well is the safety threat; the winds were uncontrollable too. Because the mast would be so high up it was impossible to predict the ever-changing winds at that altitude. With the winds, the dirigibles would not be able to stay in one place, which was another safety issue the architects had over looked. After all the safety issues and weather problems, there was still the fact that a law forbid the idea, essentially rendering it impossible. Making the mast idea out of the question. With all the risky and dangerous tasks they would of had to dealt with, the mast was never built, and very unfortunate that after all the planning, there was absolutely no way the dirigibles could ever land there. Thus, a grand vision was ultimately grounded by practical limitations."
1269	16102	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @ORGANIZATION2 the architects faced many reasons in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The architects couldn't put a mooring mast at first because it would add stress to the building's frame. Consequently, the architects had to modify and strengthen the steel frame of the building to accomplish the new situation they were undertaking. Before putting the mooring mast in place, the architects designed a shiny glass, chrome-nickel stainless steel tower to complement the overall shape of the building. Even before constructing the mooring mast on top of the building the roof had to be completed to support the structure. However, when putting the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building; it didn't work out as intended. When they tested it the dirigible didn't get close enough to tie it up securely. So, ultimately, the endeavor described in ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2 did not achieve its intended purpose."
1270	16103	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced spurred them to develop solutions as they hoped to achieve something greater and more spectacular. The ambition to construct such a towering structure in record time required overcoming logistical challenges and pushing the boundaries of existing engineering practices. Ultimately, their determination to surpass previous architectural feats fueled innovation and contributed to the building's iconic status.
1271	16104	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building had great plans to allow dirigibles, also known as blimps, to dock there. Although they kept their expectations high, they faced many obstacles while trying to make this happen. The first problem they ran into was the fact that the steel frame of the building would have to be strengthened due to the stress of the dirigible's load. So, the architects had to make changes to the building's skeleton, adding significant cost and complexity to the project. Safety was also an issue because hydrogen made the blimps flammable, which could cause a destruction by fire. There was also an existing law stating ""airships can't fly to low over urban areas."" Dirigibles wouldn't be allowed to tie up to the building, let alone even reach that area. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Due to heavy winds, the dirigibles would swivel around too much, and the area was not open enough to weigh down the back with lead weights, hindering the docking process. So, the architects of the Empire State Building faced too many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to successfully dock there, leading to the abandonment of the ambitious plan."
1272	16105	6	3	When the Empire State Building was conceived, it was planned to be the tallest building. However not many know that the original purpose of the mast was to serve as a landing spot for dirigibles, also known as blimps. In the 1920's, dirigibles were being hailed as the transportation of the future. The Empire State Building was going to have a mooring mast at its top for docking these new airships. However in trying to do this the builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some of these dirigibles were as long as one thousand feet, & this is where the first obstacle they faced comes into play. Since the dirigibles were so long the first obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area, as there wasn't space for maneuvering. Also the architects could not simply drop a mooring mask on top of the Empire State Building's roof. That plus a 1,000 ft dirigible moored at the top, would have stressed the building's frame. This would be another obstacle the workers encountered. The mooring mask was destined to never fulfill its purpose, do to the safety of many people as the winds at that height were too strong to safely moor the airships. This was yet another obstacle the workers faced. The final obstacle and the practical reason why dirigibles couldn't moor at the building, was an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas. These are the many obstacles the builders faced in attempting to dock dirigibles on the Empire State Building, ultimately preventing the realization of this ambitious plan.
1273	16106	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles to allowing dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the wind at the top of the building. The winds there were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". This made it dangerous for a dirigible to stop there, as maneuvering such a large craft in unpredictable gusts would be incredibly challenging. Another obstacle was a law against flying dirigibles over cities. The law made it ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"". Since they were banned from doing this, no pilot would ever go there. A third obstacle was the decreasing use of dirigibles. With the Hindenburg incident on May 6, 1937 and the increasing use of airplanes, not many people flew on airships anymore. The public lost confidence in the safety of airships, making the docking station obsolete. In conclusion, several obstacles prevented the docking of dirigibles to the Empire State Building, ultimately rendering the intended purpose unrealizable."
1274	16107	6	3	"In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. In order for the dirigibles to anchor there, a mooring mast must be added to the building's design. The architects then had to find a way to accommodate ""a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building"" without adding undue stress to the building's frame. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was the nature itself,"" particularly unpredictable weather conditions. Architects knew that they could not control the weather, and this worried them, considering the impact of strong winds on a massive airship. Another obstacle the builders faced was the existing ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" which would be necessary for docking. If dirigibles were able to reach the building, something could go wrong with the landing. Builders ""feared that the wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area,"" causing damage and potential disaster. The obstacles the builders faced soon became pointless when ""the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers had quietly disappeared,"" rendering the docking station concept obsolete."
1275	16108	6	3	In attempting to build a working mooring dock for dirigibles on the Empire State Building the works set themselves a hard task. First they had to make sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications so that the building would withstand the weight and added wind pressure of a moored dirigible. Also, a prexisting law made it impossible for dirigibles to come as low to the city as they needed to be to dock. Finally constant changes in wind current and other weather made a safe docking at the Empire State Building nearly impossible because the dirigible might get blown into the sharp roofs of nearby buildings and instead of being weighted down by lead like they would when they landed in fields as they normally would, they would be tied up, dangling over pedestrians, ultimately making the entire endeavor far too risky to be practical.
1276	16109	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced were comprehended too late. First they had to figure out a way to go about this, but they also needed government officials to agree that it's a safe way to execute Al's plan. The roof couldn't be flat, so they had to create something else for the dirigible to land on. But the dirigible being held on by one cable ""would add stress to the building's frame"" and would be sent down all the way to its foundation, which means they would have to modify their model of what the Empire State building was going to be. But one of the worst obstacles the builders had to face was the fact that dirigibles are highly flammable, a significant concern given the hydrogen they used. And there are many people and other building in the vicinity that could be put in danger. Also, the weather takes a toll on how the dirigible is going to act in the air; if it's rough, it could cause major safety problems. There was and has been a law restricting airships from ""flying too low over urban areas."" Clearly, this idea was over from the start, but no one took the time to realize it, ultimately dooming the project."
1277	16110	6	3	The obstacles of The *Airship Moorings* of Them Empire state building were some big ones which led to some Problems. for *Starters*, There was a lack of a Landing area for the Dirigible. But the *Biggest* reason was the lack of saftey there for This dream could Not be accomplished. Ultimately, safety concerns surrounding the dirigible moorings proved too significant to overcome, halting the ambitious project.
1278	16111	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there is as follows. The first challenge was to find ""a practical, workable arrangement"" for the engineers to be able to work well and safely. Another problem the builders faced was how to put a ""thousand-foot dirigible moored"" into a building that was 1,046 feet tall. The main obstacle they faced was the fact that the dirigible moored ""would add stress to the building's frame"" which may cause it to fall due to its weight. For the builders to overcome the challenge, they would have to modify and give more strength to the ""steel frame of the Empire State Building."" Ultimately, the builders went through a lot of obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the building, but in the end it was all worth their hard work to make Al Smith keep his winning title."
1279	16112	6	3	"When attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced obstacles regarding laws, safety, and even the nature of the mast itself. There was a law at the time prohibiting aircraft from flying low over cities. In paragraph @NUM1, the narrator says, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"". This did not stop some dirigibles from attempting it, but it was too dangerous around other buildings, especially given the dense urban landscape. The next obstacle was about safety. From the excerpt, ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammible"". An incident like that with the Hindenburg over a city like New York would be devastating, resulting in catastrophic loss of life and property. The third obstacle was that the mast was simply not suited for holding a dirigible. The narrator points out, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"". There was no practical way to hold the back end of the dirigible and prevent it from colliding with the building itself. In light of all these issues, builders were forced to admit that the mooring mast on the Empire State Building was indeed destined to fail as a functional dirigible docking station."
1280	16113	6	3	"In the excerpt called ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted on pages 1, @NUM1, @NUM2, @NUM3, she is basically explaining the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Examples are on page 1: ""They said that the Empire State Building would be more than ornamental, more than a spire or dome or a pyramid put there to add a desired few feet to the height of the building or to mask something as mundane as a water tank."" The vision was grand, yet the practical challenges, as Lusted illustrates, ultimately proved insurmountable, preventing the realization of this ambitious docking plan."
1281	16114	6	3	While dirigibles were being invented in the early 1930s, many workers and financial men and women faced problems when trying to dock them. A dirigible was a live propeller that passengers who boarded could ride; it was a closed compartment under the balloon. Getting back to the point of these inventions, dirigibles were a dangerous device from what the passage says. From outside the United States they used hydrogen, not helium, and the cause and effect in using hydrogen is that it is highly flammable. The German dirigible named Hindenburg exploded by the cause of fire on May 6, 1937, in Lakehurst, New Jersey. Dirigibles were a very dangerous device used back in the 1930s. So then, by the late 1930s, the idea of wing transportational dirigibles faded away. Later on, they took passengers' baggage compartments of dirigibles and made it into the world's largest soda fountain and tea garden, marking the end of an era for this risky mode of transportation.
1282	16115	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were safety, nature itself, and the law. Safety was a primary concern because dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable; an accident like the ""German dirigible Hindenburg,"" which was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, was a real possibility. Nature was the second problem because violent air currents at that height could shift the dirigible, causing damage to the airship and potentially harming pedestrians below. Law was the final obstacle; a law existed against airships flying too low over urban areas. The statement in the excerpt says, ""This law would make it illegal for ships to ever tie up to the building,"" which made the entire docking station concept pointless from its inception, rendering the investment in its construction essentially useless."
1283	16116	6	3	"In this excerpt of ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, we learn about how the spire on top of the Empire State Building was actually meant to be a landing spot for dirigibles. However, it could never actually have a dirigible dock there, for various reasons. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to tie up at the mooring mast. First, they could not because they were mostly made of hydrogen, which is very flammable. This is an especially big problem since the dirigible would possibly catch fire above New York City. Next, there was the problem of winds. The wind at the top of the mast is extremely violent and the back of the dirigible would constantly be swinging around. Using lead weights to hold it down were a possibility, ""but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" The last problem, and possibly the most obvious, is that there was a law that prohibited airships, like dirigibles, from flying too low over densely populated areas. Therefore, this ""would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" @CAPS1, as demonstrated in this excerpt of ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles, though they should've seen them coming, in trying to get dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast, ultimately making the initial vision for the spire impractical and highlighting the unforeseen challenges of integrating cutting-edge technology into urban environments."
1284	16117	6	3	"Construction always has challenges. In the excerpt from The Mooring Mask by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, there are many challenges for the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to land dirigibles there. Some of the obstacles the builders faced included the enormous size of the dirigibles, the frame would need to be modified, the cost, and nature itself. Landing the dirigibles would be a hard task. For one, the dirigibles are enormous, they are ""a thousand-foot"" long flying devices. This would make it extremely difficult to land just because of its weight. The stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" This is a struggle because the ""steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified."" This modification would take lots of effort and planning and the builders would have to accommodate for the mooring mast. Plus, modification also brings up the problem of cost. There would have to be ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications."" That cost is mindblowing and would create challenges of how to get that money and allocate the resources. In addition nature itself was an obstacle. Winds at the top of the building were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Nature would bring up many challenges for the builders to have to work around and find solutions to stabilize the dirigibles. Overall, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there."
1285	16118	6	3	"@CAPS1 @CAPS2 ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, talks about the height of the buildings, the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building. The architect who built the Chrysler Building was secretly hiding something. The secret was that he constructed a 185-foot spire inside the building; this ingenious design shocked many people and the media when he hoisted it to the top of the Chrysler Building. Now it's a height of 1,046 feet, which is 46 feet taller than the height of the Empire State Building. One obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith thought that a mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service to let passengers on and off. The mooring mast couldn't just simply be dropped on top of the building. Adding a mooring mast to a cable tether could add stress to the building's frame, requiring careful engineering. They finally built the mooring mast and triumphantly raised the American flag again, signifying a new era of possibilities, even if those possibilities never fully materialized."
1286	16119	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced several problems in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. Safety was a primary issue for the builders. The dirigibles made outside of the United States were often used with hydrogen for lift. This became a safety issue because ""hydrogen is highly flammable"". On top of the building, the wind is always shifting because of ""violent air currents"". The shifting winds would be a problem because they would cause the end of the ship to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Another problem the builders faced was the ""law against airships flying too low of urban areas""; making it illegal to dock the dirigibles at the intended height. The builders also feared that the high winds could ""blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area"", causing danger to the city and potential widespread damage. There are many significant obstacles the builders faced that ultimately made it impossible for the dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building."
1287	16120	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting dirigibles to dock there include wind, weather, and especially safety issues. The excerpt states ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". This states that nature was a great obstacle for the plan of dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. The other largest obstacle was safety. The excerpt says, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This presented a severe risk, as any spark could have catastrophic consequences. Another main safety concern was that the use of lead weights to anchor the dirigible was neither practical nor safe above the city of pedestrians. The possibility of these weights falling posed an unacceptable danger. Therefore, the combination of unpredictable weather conditions and significant safety hazards ultimately rendered the dirigible docking plan unfeasible."
1288	16121	6	3	"Allowing dirigibles to dock to the Empire State Building was never a safe idea. ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" Significant obstacles arose once the idea got thrown around. Builders soon realized that docking the dirigibles to the Empire State Building would cause stress to the building; ""Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" Safety was a major obstacle because dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen that was highly flammable. Then the obstacle of wind came and played a crucial role. Usually they would weigh them down but that was not ideal being so close to other buildings and hovering over thousands of people. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" Ultimately, the ambitious idea was never successful due to the insurmountable obstacles presented."
1289	16122	6	3	Some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the law, and the spires that were on other buildings. Another problem was making the mooring mast. This was a problem because it would add a lot of stress to the building. And safety was an issue. The law restricted this because you can't put a blimp over urban areas; if something goes wrong, a lot of pedestrians will be killed. Putting up the mooring mast was no easy task; it was very hard to make it support a blimp because there would be too much pressure on the building. Lastly, safety: there were blimps that caught fire because of the gases they worked with. If that were to happen in New York, a lot of innocent lives would be gone, making the entire endeavor far too risky to justify.
1290	16123	6	3	"The builders faced many different obstacles in their attempt to allowing Blimps to dock there. There were two major obstacles. ""The greatest reason was one of safety: Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly @CAPS1"" (flammable) (@NUM1). If a blimp had an accident like the Hindenburg, not only would the Empire State building go down, it would affect other buildings and people too because of the city's population. Lastly the other large effect on the building was the weather. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@NUM2). The winds could have easily knock it over with a blimp attatched to it for this reason: ""the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (@NUM2). As result to this the blimb would be so close to the mast that if a strong enoungh wind was blowing, the blimps weight you take the mast with it. All in all weather and hydrogen blimps were the builders' two major obstacles, ultimately making the ambitious blimp docking plan impractical and unsafe."
1291	16124	6	3	"Al Smith's plan to add two hundred and fifty feet of height onto the Empire State Building by attaching a resting stop for traveling blimps was plausible in theory, but as it was put in motion the workers had to face multiple obstacles that ultimately made the attempt unsuccessful. The easiest and the only fixable obstacle was the issue of the added stress the blimp put on the building's frame. The whole building had to be strengthened to adjust to the pressure, and this involved considerable time and resources, but the workers eventually got the construction done. However, the biggest thing that hindered the mooring mast from being successful was nature itself. The winds that high in the air were constantly shifting violently, so even if the dirigible had been attached to the mast, the back of it would swivel around uncontrollably. Unfortunately because they would have landed high in the air, using lead weights to control the back of the aircraft was impractical. The prevention of nature's problems is not possible, and similarly nothing could have been done to fix the issue of unsafety. Most blimps outside of the United States used a more flammable gas inside of them, and landing a dirigible that could catch on fire high above New York City was an extremely dangerous idea. There was nothing the workers could have done to solve other countrie's blimp composition. Finally, if nothing else, there were solid laws that made it illegal to ever have anything tied up so low over an urban area. Obviously, this obstacle couldn't have been overcome without waiting years and a lot of legal business. Placing the mooring mast on the Empire State Building with hope to land dirigibles seemed good, but during the actual process many obstacles were presented, most of which had no solution. In the end, the hope to ""equip [the building] for an age of transportation,"" had to be given up."
1292	16125	6	3	The problems that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were the issues of safety. As said in paragraph @NUM1 the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making docking a challenge. Also said in paragraph @NUM1 there would be lead weights dangling above pedestrians on the street, posing a significant risk. One other problem they faced was the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, further complicating the docking proposal. These challenges ultimately proved insurmountable, rendering the dirigible docking station impractical.
1293	16126	6	3	"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, would be things such as the different usage of air. A sentence I found to follow this reason would be in paragraph @NUM1 when said, ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This would cause many problems and face many obstacles, as a spark could ignite the hydrogen causing a catastrophic explosion in the middle of New York City. Another reasoning I found was wind. A reason I found would be as stated in paragraph @NUM2, ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" This would be something difficult to fix, requiring significant structural reinforcement to withstand the immense forces. As other obstacles I found such as the size and density, I find these two to be the best reasoning, clearly demonstrating the significant challenges that ultimately made the dirigible docking plan impractical."
1294	16127	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were that the most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and the hydrogen is highly flammable, posing a significant safety risk. The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof; significant engineering considerations were involved. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation and the enormous forces involved in docking a large airship. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area, for example downtown New York, leading to potentially catastrophic consequences. The greatest obstacle was nature itself, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making a stable docking nearly impossible. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship with swivel around and around the mooring mast, creating a dangerous situation. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights to provide stability, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe, rendering the idea unfeasible. Thus, the combination of flammable gas, structural challenges, safety concerns, and unpredictable weather ultimately thwarted the dirigible docking plan.
1295	16128	6	3	Based on the excerpt, there were a few main obsticles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof; it would add unwanted stress to the building frame. Another issue was the gas used to fill the dirigibles. Hydrogen, being very flamable, could cause a dangerous fire above a densley populated area, downtown New York. Towards the top of the building, violent air currents caused another problem. Even if the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mast. A final delema was an existing law that prohibited airships flying to low over urban areas, such as New York. Due to these obsticles, the ability to dock a dirigible to the top of the Empire State Building was destined to fail, as these challenges proved too difficult to overcome at the time.
1296	16129	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many problems trying to make dirigibles able to dock there. One problem was that the blimps use hydrogen instead of helium to fly. ""Most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The blimps were unable to be used because they were a major safety issue for the people being transported, given the risk of fire. Another obstacle was that the air currents were very rough at the top of the Empire State building. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring asked, the back of the ship which swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Dirigibles are usually put down in open fields where the back ends can be put down with lead weights; the blimps dangling high above pedestrians was neither practical nor safe. The builders for the Empire State building faced many obstacles, ultimately rendering the dirigible docking plan infeasible."
1297	16130	6	3	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast the builders of the empire state building had to go through many obstacles to get there job done. In paragraph @NUM1 it states that Al Smith announces that the Empire State Building will reach a height of @NUM2 feet, this would be a big obstacle for the builders because they have to risk their lives being that high up just to construct this building. The workers needed to be brave and fearless while also performing the tasks that were required of them. Another obstacle for the workers would be working next to the dirigibles because in the exerpt it states that the dirigible is extremely flammable, so if it touches fire, the workers could get seriously hurt. The workers would have to take extra precaution to ensure they are doing everything in a safe manner. Overcoming these challenges demonstrates the builders' dedication and resilience in completing the Empire State Building.
1298	16131	6	3	"In the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 ""The Mooring MASt"" by @ORGANIZATION2, The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle to their expanded use in new york city was the lack of a suitable landing area that could accommodate the large airships. Another obstacle was getin the passengers on and off the dirigbles safley, especially considering the high altitude and potential weather conditions. In conclusion I have showend the obstacles that the builders have faced on the @ORGANIZATION1."
1299	16132	6	3	"The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted describes the problems that the builders of the Empire State Building faced like the amount of stress that the dirigibles would add to the frame of the building, safety issues and laws, and the winds around the mast. Any dirigible would add on tremendous stress to the already constructed frame of the building and builders had to complete ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications."" These changes were quickly made, but safety concerns such as a potential fire or ""flying too low over urban areas"", (which was actually illegal), still prevailed. The ""greatest obstacle"" of building the mast was the violent winds that surrounded the Empire State Building. These winds were ""constantly shifting"", making it virtually impossible to stay in one spot without swiveling around the building. In a city as densely populated as New York, it also wasn't even an option to weigh down dirigibles for landing. This list of obstacles is a clear sign that the mooring mast was not properly thought about before construction started. The builders should have focused more on what they had done instead of trying to outdo the expectations of all and do something as ""a higher calling,"" which ultimately led to an impractical addition to a groundbreaking building."
1300	16133	6	3	"There were many obstacles builders needed to face to make it possible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. First was the stress that would be put on the entire building if a dirigible was attached to a mast at the top. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way through to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" (@NUM1) This problem was easily solved by strengthening the frame of the building with additional steel. Another major problem was the wind 1,250 feet in the air; the wind blows very hard and violently. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" (@NUM2) The wind combined with the fact that a dirigible was filled with hydrogen made a bad combination. Hydrogen is a very combustible gas, and if a dirigible ran into the building and there was a spark, the entire mass of the ship would be enflamed, creating a disastrous situation. These factors, among others, ultimately contributed to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan."
1301	16134	6	3	"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow blimps to dock there was the height of the building. For instance in paragraph @NUM1 it states ""the steel frame of the building would have to be modified, over six thousand dollars worth of modifications"" This proves that the height of the empire was its height because the city had to pay modification fees. Furthermore, the added weight of the blimp and its passengers would also require reinforcement. Also, because the building is so tall the mast is not that stable so that was the main obstacle stated in paragraph @NUM2 ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" This demonstrates that mast in those currents and not being stable enough could be very dangerous for downtown New York. The unpredictable nature of the winds made it difficult to safely secure a massive airship. Lastly, even state laws became an obstacle for the dirigibles such as in paragraph @NUM3 it states ""this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building"". This justifies that this was also an obstacle that the builders faced, essentially making the blimp docking idea legally impossible. These significant engineering, safety, and legal challenges ultimately made the ambitious blimp docking plan unfeasible."
1302	16135	6	3	The obstacles the builders had to face were very big obstacles. One of them being the Mooring Mast itself. The building which wasn't strong enough to hold an airship with its original design. So the building had to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this situation, involving significant engineering challenges. They would add a rocket shaped tower built out of shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel. This tower would illuminate from the inside, not only serving a practical purpose but also becoming a beacon. Which would bump the building from @NUM1 floors to 102 floors. I got all this information from paragraphs @NUM2, highlighting the ingenuity required to overcome these structural limitations.
1303	16136	6	3	"Based on the excerpt some obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there included the laws restricting plane height, the fact that some dirigibles used hydrogen fuel instead of helium, and lastly at such great heights the strong wind currents were a problem as well. The restriction of plane height was that planes could not fly too low above cities without being a safety hazard, posing a regulatory hurdle. ""An existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". (The MOORING MAST). Another obstacle related to the fact that some dirigibles from outside of the U.S. used hydrogen fuel in place of helium which could cause a problem because hydrogen is highly flammable, raising concerns about potential explosions. ""From outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium"". (The Mooring Mast). Lastly, strong winds were an obstacle as well; the high wind currents would blow the dirigibles all around as they attempted to dock at the Empire State Building, which would pose as a problem for safe and controlled mooring. ""Winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". (The Mooring Mast). In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, ultimately rendering the ambitious mooring mast concept impractical and unsafe."
1304	16137	6	3	There were many obsticles the builders of the Empire State Building faced to allow the dirigibles to dock. One was the weight. The architects could not just place the mooring mast or it would rush the building's structural integrity. So they had to add over sixty thousands of dollars into the framework to reinforce it. Another problem was safty issues. Other countries used Hydrogen as their dirigibles gass, a cost-effective solution. Hydrogen is highly flameable so that catching on fire above New York was dangerous, especially considering the city below. Another problem was the violent weather at the top of the building. The dirigibles would sway in the back due to harsh weather so geting pasengers on and off board would be extremly dangerous to them, and impractical in common weather conditions. Also there is a law in New York prohibiting low flying vehecales so the dirigibles could not had dock their in the first place, making the whole endeavor legally questionable and ultimately unfeasible. The combination of structural costs, safety hazards, weather complications, and legal restrictions ultimately made the dirigible docking plan a short-lived and unrealized vision.
1305	16138	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. The challenges ranged from nature itself to laws against it. They didn't take into consideration the constantly shifting air atop the building. At such heights as the mooring mast, violent air currents would cause the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast. This was also due to the fact that the blimp would only be tethered in the front. Not only were those large factors coming into play but laws also came in the way of dirigibles mooring at the Empire State. They didn't think about the existing law. It stated that airships flying too low or over urban areas was against the law. So many factors came into play with building such a project, making the entire endeavor quite complex. Overall it was too far fetched of an idea.
1306	16139	6	3	There were a few obstacles to making this idea work. One of the obstacles was to make the mast and the frame of the building strong enough to support a dirigible swaying in the wind. There was over $1 million spent on modifications to the building. Also, they had to add a few floors to the building for a total of 102 floors, demonstrating the scale of the project.
1307	16140	6	3	"Based on the excerpt 'The Mooring Mast' by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, there are many varied obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One main reason would be the safety issues of the dirigible. Most dirigibles used hydrogen to be lighter than air. Hydrogen is a very flammable gas that could easily catch fire, just like the Hindenburg. If an accident like the Hindenburg were to happen over downtown New York, the outcome would not be good. Also dirigibles moored in open fields and would need to be anchored with big lead weights. These weights would neither be practical nor safe dangling above people and a small mooring on the top of a building is no open field. One last obstacle is the sixty thousand dollars needed to just make the frame suitable for mooring dirigibles. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of a building held by a single cable tether would add stress to the building's frame."" The building’s structural integrity was paramount, and this additional stress posed a significant engineering challenge. With out a doubt, just to make a mooring for dirigibles at the top of the tallest building in the world would come with many different obstacles the builders would have to face."
1308	16141	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacle attempts to allow dirigible to dock there. First the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill it's purpose because the builders didn't notice all the problems it had. One attempt was the Goodyear blimp Columbia, attempted a publicity stunt where it would tie up and deliver a bundle of newspapers to the Empire State Building, as stated in paragraph @NUM1. In paragraph @NUM2 it states that the greatest obstacle to the successful use of mooring mast was nature itself, specifically the unpredictable and powerful winds at that altitude. The builders had a lot of work to do to actually try and fix the problems but there was just to many, with safety concerns ultimately proving insurmountable. In conclusion the builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacle attempts to allow dirigible to dock there.
1309	16142	6	3	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were significant; there wasn't enough room on the mooring mast for passengers and cargo to disembark safely, and city regulations weren't supposed to have aircraft, especially large airships, operating so close to densely populated areas. Ultimately, these challenges made the impractical docking plan unfeasible.
1310	16143	6	3	Despite the pricey investments of sixty thousand dollars that needed to be put into the building for this project to become a reality, there were many more obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The greatest obstacle they faced was the safety of people; a dirigibles dangleing nearly 1,250 feet above ground with the possibility of explosion and pedestrians below doesn't seem like the smartest idea. Another problem they faced was the stress that the dirigible-held on by only a single cable-would put on the buildings frame. With the wind blowing the dirigible around the load and pressure of it would have to be sent all the way to the base of the building about 1,250 feet down. In order for this to work the builders would have to strengthen the steel frame of the building. Maybe the most difficult obstacle they faced was nature itself, strong wind streams above the building would have caused the dirigible to swing around once it was docked, as well as running the risk of being blown of course and into another building. And if they ever wanted this idea to work in the first place they should have checked the laws first; aircrafts were not allowed to fly that low over urban areas. Builders of this landing dock and the empire state building just faced too many obstacles.
1311	16144	6	3	Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were mostly due to the dangers of violent winds at such an altitude that may cause the aircraft to crash either into the building or down to the ground. For example two blimps attempted the docking, and one of them could not come close to the building because of winds. The other was able to deliver a bundle of newspapers hoisted down by a rope, highlighting a partially successful but ultimately precarious maneuver. In conclusion, the main problem was the instability of the aircraft being docked, rendering the docking idea impractical.
1312	16145	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to dock dirigibles there. One of the obstacles they faced was safety, because the dirigibles were filled with hydrogen. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (∂ @NUM1). The risk of fire was substantial. If the dirigible burst into flames in New York, a lot of people would die. Another obstacle was nature itself. The winds were violent on top of the building. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (∂ @NUM2). The unpredictable weather made controlling the massive airships extremely challenging. This would have been very dangerous. A third obstacle was the law, which was impossible to get around. There ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (∂ @NUM3). Although this was broken twice, it was still illegal to dock dirigibles at that low height. The legal ramifications presented yet another hurdle. As a cause of all these obstacles, the idea to dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building was scrapped; the combination of safety concerns, environmental factors, and legal restrictions proved to be insurmountable."
1313	16146	6	3	The builder of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there because they had to plan out how it would work and what they would need for it to dock there. This involved considering the materials needed to create a functional mooring mast atop the skyscraper. A strong, reinforced steel structure would be essential to withstand the immense forces exerted by a massive airship, especially in windy conditions. Durable, weather-resistant cables and winches would be necessary to secure the dirigible to the mast. Furthermore, a specialized gangplank or walkway, possibly made of lightweight but sturdy aluminum, would be required to allow passengers and crew to safely disembark and embark. Before actual construction, detailed engineering models and wind tunnel tests would have been crucial to ensure the safety and stability of the entire docking apparatus, ultimately necessitating careful planning for the appropriate materials and their implementation.
1314	16147	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building ran into a lot of problems involving the dirigibles. One problem is that there was no easy way to make such a suitable docking station at such a great height, while making it look good, and the mooring mast's aesthetic integration with the building was a significant concern. The other, most main reason/problem with the mast for mooring the dirigibles was just a safety issue, but a big one. Most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is extremely flammable. So, if something were to go wrong with docking, the dirigible could catch fire and explode & go down in a densely populated area, creating a catastrophic scenario. There were a lot of safety and structure issues, but they were eventually resolved, (like the fact that large lead weights needed to dangle over the streets to weigh down the back of the dirigible), showcasing the engineering ingenuity required to address the challenges of the time.
1315	16148	6	3	"In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building engineers had to face many obsticals. Alot of obsticals were straightforward and not ecnoliged By the engineers for example ON page three it says that is was ""unsafe Because the dirigibles were filled with Hydrogen"" wich is Highly flammable. there were safety concerns in the planning Because of them Being flammable the german Dirigible Hindenburg was Destroyed By fire. there was also violent air currents and a law against air ships flying too low over urban areas, ultimately making the docking plan unfeasible and unsafe to execute."
1316	16149	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first issue faced was that ""most of dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This was a significant problem because if the dirigible were to catch fire or explode over a highly populated city like New York, many people would be put at risk of being injured or killed. The second issue the builders had to face was that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These winds would cause the airship to swivel, even when tethered to the mooring mast, making boarding extremely difficult and dangerous. This would also be dangerous for anyone aboard the airship attempting to disembark or embark. The third issue was that there ""... was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" With New York City certainly being an urban area this law made it impossible for airships to even approach the Empire State Building to moor without violating regulations. Overall, there were many obstacles faced by builders in trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. Due to these reasons, the Empire State Building was never an effective place for dirigibles to dock."
1317	16150	6	3	Trying to construct the Empire State Building in a way to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the building, brought up many challenges for the builders. There was a huge safety issue having the blimps so close to the city. In paragraph @NUM1, the fear of winds that could blow the blimp into other buildings, wrecking them, scared people. The second concern was the fact that the blimp is full of highly flammable gas and if the blimp was ever to burst into flames above a city, much damage would be done to the blimp and New York City. The last major concern is located in paragraph nine. The problem would be the amount of stress the building would take on by having a blimp tied to the top of it, especially during turbulent weather. The whole building would have to be reconstructed to help the Empire State Building not take on that stress; In fact, basically every part of the building and blimp would have to be remodeled in order to keep New York City, and the passengers of the dirigible safe, making the project ultimately unfeasible and too risky to pursue.
1318	16151	6	3	"One of the obstacles builders faced was nature itself. The @CAPS1 States ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Another obstacle the builders faced was that ""there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" The @CAPS1 states ""This law will make it illegal for a ship to ever be tied up to the building,"" presenting a significant challenge to their planned use of airships in the construction process. These environmental and legal hurdles complicated the already ambitious project."
1319	16152	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building had a few obstacles to face when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, as written by Marcia Amidon L¸sted in the,The Mooring Mast. Al Smith, the architect of the Empire State Building, didn't want his masterpiece to be only for show, so he gave it purpose; a dock for dirigibles. By adding a comma ""thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether,"" the buildings frame would be under much stress; ultimately making the structure unsafe. Wind conditions at that height were unpredictable and strong. To alter the frame and wind pressure, over @MONEY1 would need to be accumulated. If an accident were to take place, like in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the densely populated city would be in grave danger. Although these obstacles can be overcome, the obstacle of mother nature herself, cannot. With high winds and unpredictable weather patterns, docking a dirigible at such a height proved too risky, making the mooring mast concept ultimately unfeasible."
1320	16153	6	3	"As it was, the idea of a dirigible dock was quite far fetched. The first problem they encountered was that having a thousand foot long dirigible attached to the Empire State Building would cause a great strain on the building's framework. They would have to change the structure of the entire building to strengthen its framework. The largest problem was a matter of safety, as dirigibles use hydrogen, which is extremely flammable. Also, the author states, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" making the idea of a dirigible dock extremely risky. These risks should have been spotted before so much money was put into making this dock, proving the impracticality of the endeavor."
1321	16154	6	3	"Builders faced multiple obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One obstacle was that the dirigible would add too much stress to the frame of the building if it landed there, requiring costly modifications. The building would have to be modified costing over sixty thousand dollars more. Another obstacle faced was the gas inside the dirigible. Some used hydrogen which is extremely flammable. Since New York is highly populated, if something were to go wrong, it would be unsafe for the city. Also, the winds at the top of the building were very strong, creating hazardous conditions. The back of the dirigible would be ""swivelling around the mooring mast,"" making docking dangerous. The last obstacle would be that it is ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up or approach of building,"" presenting a legal barrier. The attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building failed due to these various concerns. There were too many obstacles to overcome, making the venture impractical."
1322	16155	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allow the dirigibles to dock there. For example, the author said ""the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" This shows that not only did they have to design for the load of the building but also the dirigible. Moreover the author stated that, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top by a single cable tether,"" meant the engineers would have to think of a way to safely dock the dirigible without anyone getting hurt. The sheer scale and potential dangers involved in securing such a massive airship to the building presented significant engineering challenges. In all, the engineers that designed the Empire State Building had to overcome many obstacles to allow the dirigibles to dock there, demonstrating innovative problem-solving skills."
1323	16156	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" The builders could not simply ""drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" The builders now had to find a way to add this mooring mast for dirigibles without putting too much pressure on the building. In addition, ""The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation,"" requiring extensive planning and labor. They now had to add ""over sixty thousand dollars"" worth of modifications to the building, a considerable expense at the time. In conclusion, ""Architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from the inside, with a step-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself."" This design elegantly concealed the necessary structural reinforcements. @CAPS1 the architects went through much work not only to make the mooring mast for dirigibles successful, but beautiful. The excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", @ORGANIZATION2 shows the many obstacles architects faced while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."
1324	16157	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders' main obstacle were the wind currents the dirigibles had to face in trying to dock nearly eleven hundred feet in the air. The harsh winds at the top of the building were constantly changing because of the air currents. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles could not even get close enough to tie up to the mast. ""The captain could not even take his hands off the control levers"" (L¸sted @NUM1) in fear the outer shell would be punctured by the mast. Additionally, if a dirigible was tied to the mast, it would be moving all around the mast based on the unpredictable air currents. However, safety was also a major factor. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (L¸sted @NUM2). This posed a significant risk to the building and the surrounding area. Therefore, attempting to tie dirigibles to the mast of the Empire State Building was very unsafe, as the obstacles the builders faced were simply too much to overcome."
1325	16158	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles, also known as blimps, to dock there. The initial problem was that the blimp couldn't land on a flat surface. So the builders made a ""mooring mast"" so blimps could be connected by electrical winch to the building. But this caused problems too. They couldn't just drop the mooring mast on top of the building or it would be unstable. But most importantly since the winds kept changing it would never stay still, making the docking procedure precarious. Also, the problem of foreign blimps using hydrogen rather than helium made it too dangerous to the public due to hydrogen's flammability. In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges in trying to let blimps dock."
1326	16159	6	3	"There were obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the many obstacles the dirigibles had to face was the lack of a suitable landing area, which I found on paragraph six. Another obstacle would be on paragraph seven where it says ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Nature itself would be another obstacle for the dirigibles, because ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Last but not least, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, further hindering the practicality of the docking plan. Which means it is illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even go near the area. In conclusion these were some out of the many obstacles a dirigible had to face."
1327	16160	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building bit off more than they could chew when constructing a mooring mast there. The first of several problems was that the presence of a thousand-foot long Dirigible would add a tremendous amount of stress to the frame of the building, and millions of dollars worth of modifications would have to be added. Safety was another pressing issue. In 1937, the crash of the Hindenburg made the owners of the building realize how bad it would be if a zeppelin crashed over densely-populated New York. Not only was there an existing law that forbid airships to fly too low over urban areas, the factor of nature made the mooring mast idea completely impractical. Winds on top of the building are always shifting due to violent air currents; even the captain of the U.S. Navy ship Los Angeles could not land the dirigible. At this point, it was apparent that the mooring mast idea would not work, and dirigibles were abandoned when airplanes, the method of aviation of the future, had arrived, thus ending the impractical dream of mooring airships to the Empire State Building.
1328	16161	6	3	While attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State building the builders faced many obstacles. The first obstacle was modifying the frame of the building to acommodate for the stress that the mooring mast would put on the building. The load of the dirigible and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the foundation of the building which was eleven-hundred feet below. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made in altering the frame of the building. It was costly, especially considering the Great Depression was underway. Another obstacle the builders face was the gas used inside the dirigible, hydrogen. Most dirigibles outside of the United States use hydrogen. Hydrogen is highly flammable and if a dirigible were to go up in flames above such a densely populated area such as downtown New York the results of the accident would be catastrophic. Nature was also another obstacle itself. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents. The dirigible would be swiveling around and around the mast, making docking dangerous. While lead weights were used in open landing fields to help stabilize airships, this was impractical to do above pedestrians on the street. Above all else an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. This made it illegal for a dirigible to even approach the mast. These obstacles had made it impractical for a dirigible to ever dock on the mooring mast of the Empire State Building, effectively ending the ambitious plan.
1329	16162	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The hydrogen in the dirigibles was highly flammable, winds shifted a lot, and existing laws made it illegal to dock in such an area. Most dirigibles during that time were floating by hydrogen rather than helium. What the builders found out was hydrogen is very flammable and too risky to land dirigibles that could catch on fire above a whole city. The excerpt also explained that nature was a huge issue. Air currents as high as those atop the building were vicious and shifted rapidly, which would make dangling dirigibles from that high up very risky. Lastly, was the obstacle of breaking the law! The law against airships flying too low over urban areas. With all these obstacles that would be too difficult for the builders to face, this unreal dream would yet remain a dream, ultimately proving to be an impractical and dangerous proposition that could never come to fruition.
1330	16163	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several problems trying to allow dirigibles to dock on it. One problem was designing the building to withstand the stress from a thousand-foot dirigible swinging around in the wind. The builders needed a way to distribute the wind pressure all the way to the foundation of the massive skyscraper. Another problem was the strong winds surrounding the building; when the navy attempted a docking, the dirigible was tossed about, a problem that proved insurmountable. A third problem, finding a way to actually dock the dirigible, was quickly solved with a winch mechanism. A final problem stemmed from the inherent dangers of dirigibles and laws preventing them from flying close to buildings, effectively making the entire endeavor too risky. Ultimately, these challenges led to the abandonment of the dirigible docking idea.
1331	16164	6	3	During this time period, dirigibles were seen as the transportation of the future, and everybody thought that this was plausible. There were problems, however, that nobody saw through. For example, the dirigibles were seen to be the next big thing in transportation, but there was no evidence to support this, and the public's enthusiasm was based more on novelty than practicality. They spent all of their time, effort, and resources to construct something for a purpose that never worked, ultimately leading to wasted investments and unrealized dreams. There were other problems that were overlooked as well, such as the wind speed at that height making landings difficult, and even if they could get close enough to the mast, they would need someone to stand on the very top and tie it down, which would be too hard for one person, posing significant safety risks. As the excerpt shows, Al Smith and his architects jumped into this problem too quickly and with insufficient information, highlighting the dangers of pursuing innovation without thoroughly considering all potential challenges.
1332	16165	6	3	"In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, two architects play ""battleship"" with each of their dirigibles, competing for most height. However, when building these ""enormously steel-framed balloons"", the architects didn't realize the obstacles that they would have to face during this process. The biggest reason was for safety precautions. Since most dirigibles were made of hydrogen, they were highly flammable, adding another layer of complexity. This, they said, could have been worse than the German Hindenburg, which was demolished by fire in New Jersey in 1937. However, the best obstacle to use of the mast was nature, specifically the weather. The winds caused the masts to clang above human beings, which was not practical or safe, making the entire endeavor much more challenging."
1333	16166	6	3	"In their quest to allow dirigibles to dock, the architects and builders of the Empire State Building ran into many problems. One of the more obvious issues was that of the make-up of the dirigibles themselves. At the time, they consisted of hydrogen, which, although allowed for a lower density, was highly flammable. This concept was proven and brought to light by the 1937 crash of the ""Hindenburg"", a famous dirigible filled with hydrogen. If a dirigible were to catch fire while docking at the Empire State Building, it would surely crash onto the civilians below, creating a devastating scene. Another topic of debate for the architects of the Empire State Building was the issue of high winds at the estimated 1,250 foot altitude of the mooring mast. Such winds could easily cause a lack of stability for a dirigible which could in turn place added stress on the building itself, potentially compromising its structural integrity. Another problem caused by winds is the fact that the dirigible might crash into other buildings, causing the fabric containing the hydrogen gas to be punctured, and the dirigible to crash. In the end, it was a project deemed too risky to continue, as the potential for disaster far outweighed any perceived benefits."
1334	16167	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building were faced with many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first major problem was they weren't sure if the structure of the building could hold up to a swaying dirigible, a concern that required careful engineering analysis. As said in paragraph @NUM1. Also the builders knew that since the dirigible would be hooked to the mast by a single cable, the air currents would make the back of the ship swivel around the mooring mast, creating a potentially dangerous situation. As said in paragraph @NUM2. There also was a law enforcement against airships flying too lower over urban areas, posing a legal challenge. That would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building. Those are some of the obstacles that the builders were faced with, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan due to these significant practical and legal hurdles.
1335	16168	6	3	The Empire State Building was designed to be the tallest building in the World. Al Smith's plans were to make it taller than the new Chrysler Building, but when a 125-foot tall spire was added to the top, the Empire State Building was going to come in second. To overcome this first obstacle in building the tower, Smith decided to change the idea for the tower and add his own spire: a mooring mast for dirigibles. Using the tower as an anchor for dirigible balloons, or zeppelins, Smith added another 250 feet to the tower. But to continue with the plan, Smith had to face the obstacle of supporting a floating blimp more than 1250 feet above the ground. Smith had the entire building frame modified and strengthened before the building was finished. Smith's final obstacle was one he couldn't control: the weather. The winds at the top of the building were too harsh, so the dirigible idea was scrapped, but Al Smith's tower had made it to the world's tallest building.
1336	16169	6	3	"Throughout the process of construction, the Empire State Building contractors faced a couple of obstacles in their quest to dock dirigibles on it. First off, safety was a huge factor of the quest. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" While a balloon and dirigible may have a similar appearance, the two are completely structured differently. Helium causes a balloon to rise; a dirigible uses hydrogen to fly, which is highly flammable. Secondly, there was already a law put into effect for air trafficking. Dirigibles ""... could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. Fearing the wind would blow the dirigibles onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the shell."" If the dirigible were ever to get punctured, it could collapse into the streets of New York, causing mass destruction. Thus concluding a few of many obstacles in the way of landing dirigibles on the Empire State Building, the primary concerns were the volatile nature of hydrogen and the existing air traffic regulations hindering safe docking."
1337	16170	6	3	The Empire State Building faced many obstacles and challenges while it was being built. The builders built a rocket-shaped mast so the dirigible could be housed in the shaft itself, which also had elevators so people could go down to the lobby. This design change would bring the building to 102 floors. The glassed observation room would be on the 101st floor, providing visitors with a stunning panoramic view of the city below. The innovative design choices and solutions to construction hurdles ultimately contributed to the building's iconic status.
1338	16171	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle that they faced concerned safety. Many dirigibles from outside the United States were filled with hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is very flammable, and if it were to catch fire above New York City, the results could be horrific. Another obstacle the builders faced concerned nature. Due to the height of the Empire State Building, the wind became a major factor. Wind currents were constantly shifting, and if a dirigible was attached to it, it would be unsafe. The stress of the wind pressure and the load of the dirigible would have to be transmitted to the foundation of the building. This meant that the frame of the building would have to be strengthened. Another obstacle concerned law. There is a law that states that airships can not fly too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal to tie a ship up to the Empire State Building. The builders of the Empire State Building had to face many obstacles in an attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there, highlighting the impracticality of the ambitious plan.
1339	16172	6	3	"The mooring mast seems like a great idea. A landing dock for dirigibles would have jumped travel into the future. As it turns out, however, architect Al Smith bit off more than he could chew. First of all, the fate of the Hindenburg put worry over the owners heads. ""the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that (Hindenburg) accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"". The second problem is that there is an existing law against airships flying too low in urban areas. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""This law would make it illegal for the ship to tie up to the building or even approch the area"", The final and most problematic part of the mooring mast was actually revealed to be nature itself. As it turns out, the wind on top of the building were too violent and unpredictable. Even if the dirigible was tethered, ""the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"". Overall, it seems like this was a great idea gone bad."
1340	16173	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building had hopes of making this building a dock for dirigibles but were faced with several obstacles. Starting in paragraph @NUM1 the aspiration of the mast on the Empire State Building made the plan seem well put together and it would soon become a reality. As the project progressed many details went looked over and when the dirigibles were ready to take action the plan was not something forageable. Stated in paragraph @NUM2, safety was a huge issue for the dirigibles made outside of the United States, because they contained the flamable gas hydrogen, adding to the risk. This is a problem because of the fear of an accident occuring in a highly populated area. Another obsticle dirigibles faced while trying to have a dock on the Empire State Building was nature itself as presented in paragraph @NUM3. The winds on the top of the building had violent currents that were constantly shifting, creating a turbulent environment. The problem with the air would have the dirigibles constantly spinning around the building by its back end. This made it unsafe for passengers to get on and of and also the cargo. The greatest obstacle for dirigibles trying to dock on the Empire State Building is the existing law against flying too low over urban areas, which is found in paragraph @NUM4, effectively rendering the docking plan illegal. Therefore, the dream of dirigible docking was ultimately grounded by a combination of safety concerns, unpredictable weather, and legal restrictions.
1341	16174	6	3	"There were multiple obstacles that made the idea of docking dirigibles foolhardy from the start. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire..."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) in 1937, the idea of such a volatile object over the population became far more of a threat than a luxury. Lead weights needed to support the craft could not be supplied, and would also prove to be hazardous, especially if dropped. Given the Empire State Building's nature, the modifications became hasselsome and added unnecessary difficulty to the building's structure. The winds at that altitude would also provide docking issues and instability, making it hard to safely moor the airships. Finally, the airplane overtook the blimp, because it could travel faster and hold the same, if not more, number of people in a small area. Blimps became dangerous and cumbersome, and would not benefit New York as Al Smith had hoped, solidifying the impracticality of the venture."
1342	16175	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock, where nature and the law against airships flying too low over urban areas posed significant challenges. The greatest obstacle builders faced was nature; the winds at the top of the building constantly shifted due to violent air currents. The force on the back of the ships would cause the dirigible to spin. Moreover, the use of lead weights within the Empire State Building, dangling high above people on the streets, presented serious safety concerns. The second obstacle was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, making dirigible flights to the building legally impossible. Thus, both natural forces and legal restrictions ultimately thwarted the ambitious plan to use the Empire State Building as a mooring mast."
1343	16176	6	3	The Empire State Building was built with great potential, but it would never reach it fully. The Empire State Building was supposed to reach @NUM1 feet, being just inches taller than the Chrysler Building, when the architect who designed the @CAPS1 Building snuck up and stuck a 46 foot pole on top. Of course the Empire State Building had to be taller, so they set a new goal and reached 1,250 feet on December 11, 1929. Al Smith, @CAPS2 of New York and Architect, decided that the Empire State Building needed a cherry on top, so he decided to put a mooring mast for zeppelins on top. This plan was destined for disaster: the foundation wasn't stable enough for zeppelins, they could easily be blown out of control and onto the sharp tip of the Building, and also, since zeppelins had hydrogen in them, they could explode and fall onto the densely populated @LOCATION1. All in all, the mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building was built for disaster. It was a flawed concept from the start, proving impractical and ultimately dangerous.
1344	16177	6	3	There are many obstacles the builders had to face while attempting to allow the docking of dirigibles. One obstacle they had to overcome was paying over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications for the building's framework. In paragraph @NUM1, it stated that a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. The stress of the dirigible's load, and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly a hundred feet below. As a result of this issue, the frame of the entire building had to change to accommodate the new situation, demonstrating the complexity of integrating nascent airship technology. More obstacles flooded in after the new modifications. When the building had been framed to the 85th floor, the roof had to be completed before the framing for the mooring mast could take place. The mast also had to have a skeleton of steel, stated in paragraph @NUM2, further complicating construction and highlighting the unique engineering challenges presented by the dirigible mooring project.
1345	16178	6	3	It is clear that there were problems in trying to dock dirigibles on the Empire State Building. The law against flying airships too low over the Empire State Building made it hard to do so. Next is the thought of it being unsafe because some dirigibles use hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is flammable. A big reason is when the German dirigible *Hindenburg* was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey; the owners of the Empire State Building then realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had happened in such a densely populated area such as downtown New York City. The last reason was the thought that they would use lead weights to hold the dirigibles down, but they realized that it wasn't practical nor was it safe. It was clear that there were problems in the docking of dirigibles on the Empire State Building, but it is probably a much safer choice for both the residents/citizens of New York and all of the people who ever work(ed) on it such as architects, engineers and the aviation pioneers.
1346	16179	6	3	"The builders obstacle in letting dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building was alot. For one the mooring mast would add stress to the buildings frame, the weight of the dirigibles and wind pressure would be transmitted to the buildings foundation. Furthermore, ""winds were shifting due to violent air currents."" ""Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mast the back of the ships would swivel around."" And also the law that air ships cant fly low in urban areas complicated matters. Ultimately, these factors made the ambitious plan impractical, proving the challenges insurmountable."
1347	16180	6	3	"According to the excerpt from The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to attach a dirigible mooring unit to the top of the building. In paragraph 1, Marcia Amidon says ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself,"" and then describes how harsh winds could render the mast unstable and potentially cause the dirigible to sway dangerously. Another obstacle in the making of the mast was a law stating dirigibles could not fly under a certain altitude. The set altitude was higher than the building was tall, making docking impossible in accordance with regulations. The last obstacle was safety; in paragraph 2 Marcia Amidon talks about how some blimps are filled with hydrogen, which is highly flammable and could easily be ignited by static electricity or a stray spark. The effect of a blimp fire over a vastly populated area would be devastating, causing not only structural damage but also a significant loss of life. The mooring mast on the Empire State Building was an ingenious idea, but had too many obstacles to make it work practically and safely."
1348	16181	6	3	Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was one of safety. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above the densely populated areas such as downtown New York. The greatest obstacle to the use of the mooring mast was nature itself. Because the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast, a difficult maneuver to control in high winds, whereas dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights. The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area, effectively ending any possibility of the docking plan becoming a reality.
1349	16182	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. There were two main ones: Safety and Nature. The builders should have realized that the idea wasn't safe, before building. Most dirigibles from other countries use hydrogen instead of helium, which was highly flammable. An accident over densely populated New York would be bad. The biggest obstacle was nature. There were violent air currents that caused constantly shifting winds at the top of the building. This would cause the back of the ship to swivel around the mooring mast. There was also an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, further complicating matters. This means it would be illegal to tie a dirigible up to the building, anyway, making the entire endeavor impractical from the start.
1350	16183	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The mooring mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles. Their goal was to build a moor on top of the building in order for dirigibles, or blimps, to dock. In the end they were not successful. One obstacle was ""lack of a suitable landing area."" The roof was simply too small and congested for safe maneuvering. Without this, the dock would not work. Another main obstacle is the safety reason. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" They could easily catch on fire and harm many innocent people. Which leads to two other reasons. ""Nature itself,"" specifically the strong winds at that height, could easily start a fire or cause a crash. ""Existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" also presented a problem. The dirigibles could harm innocent people. Ultimately, these insurmountable challenges meant the ambitious plan was abandoned, proving the mooring mast concept to be impractical for the Empire State Building."
1351	16184	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, someone attempted a publicity stunt where they would tie up and deliver a bundle of newspapers to the Empire State Building. The workers' mooring equipment had never been installed, putting the workers having to catch the bundle of papers on a rope dangling from the blimp in great danger. Also, the wind at the top of the building put workers at great risk of falling off or dying. Ultimately, these safety concerns, along with economic factors, led to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan, proving the impracticality of such an ambitious idea.
1352	16185	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many problems when attempting to let dirigibles dock there. There were @NUM1 major problems of why it was so hard to dock them at the Empire State building. These obstacles were what was in the dirigibles, the ""nature"" of winds around New York, and a new law passed on restrictions of airships. Dirigibles unlike balloons, which are made up of Helium, dirigibles are made up of hydrogen. Hydrogen is highly flammable. This could have resulted in a terrible disaster if anything caught on fire since New York is so highly dense. Another problem they faced were the high winds of New York. They were constantly shifting, so they thought to tie the dirigibles down with lead but this would be a bad idea because if the lead ever fell it would injure many people. Lastly, they recently passed a law against airships flying too low over urban cities. If this law was very strict then the dirigibles wouldn't be allowed to dock there because it might be too close to the city. In conclusion there were many obstacles that the architects didn't think about before constructing, making the dirigible docking plan ultimately unfeasible."
1353	16186	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders were in a competition to become the tallest building in the world. This made them rush and really cut corners for this. The architects had to find a way to build this mast, and ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modification had to be made to the building's framework"". They had to fix the framework of the building so the wind wouldn't affect the rest of the building. ""The stress of the dirigibles' load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" The builders and architects had to overcome the reality, too. It was not safe, and dirigibles are highly flammable. It would be a terrible accident if one ignited in the city. Also, many laws prohibited airships flying low in urban areas. The builders had to face many problems while trying to build the tallest building."
1354	16187	6	3	"The main obstical was to be the tallest building in the world. That all changed to being able to have a mooring mast so blimps can land on it to drop-off/pick up passengers and refule. They had ""@NUM1 thousand dollars"" in renovations to sturdy the structure of the tower. They couldn't make the foundations sturdy enough to hold the weight of an @NUM2 foot ship + cargo, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the ambitious airship docking project."
1355	16188	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. ""The stress of the dirigibles load into the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below"" is understood in paragraph nine. This was a significant obstacle the builders had to face. The builders developed a plan of ""Rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from the inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself."" This design aimed to integrate the mooring mast aesthetically with the skyscraper's iconic look. Although the mast was finished, due to @CAPS1 Nature and a new law, no dirigibles have ever docked at the Empire State Building, making this ambitious plan ultimately unfulfilled."
1356	16189	6	3	"As a result of the idea to build a mooring mast, the builder faced a few obstacles in construction. The first problem was structural; the weight of the dirigible tied to it with a single tie would put great stress on the building. It was said that between the dirigible's load and wind pressure, the stress would be distributed all the way to the building's foundation. Another obstacle was safety. Many dirigibles outside the United States used Hydrogen instead of Helium, which is highly flammable. The owners realized the potential for disaster, recalling the ""Hindenburg"" incident, and understood the devastating effects a similar event could have on downtown New York. The final obstacle was nature because the winds shifted at the top of the building. The problem discussed was that despite the dirigible being tied, it could swivel around the mast due to these shifting winds, creating instability. The many obstacles faced ultimately led to the mooring mast not being constructed to its full purpose, and blimps were less commonly used as a mode of transportation."
1357	16190	6	3	"The obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were the strength of the buildings frame, Nature, and certain laws against it. A big problem with building a landing for the dirigibles on the Empire State Building was the strength of the base. ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame.""(paragraph @NUM1). This added stress could potentially compromise the structural integrity of the entire building. Another obstacle that the builders of the landing needed to get past was the element of nature. The winds at the top of the Empire State Building were always changing due to violent air currents, making docking a dangerous proposition. A dirigible tethered to a mooring mast had the potential of wrapping around the mooring mast in the unpredictable winds, potentially causing damage to the airship and the building itself. The workers could not trust the dirigibles to not fall off the mooring mast and risk the dirigible going right down where thousands of pedestrians were walking, creating a significant safety hazard. The last obstacle that the workers had to get past was an existing law that prevented airships from flying too low over urban areas. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building..."" (paragraph @NUM2), effectively rendering the entire project legally impossible. All of these obstacles proved to be too much for the workers to handle as the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building was never created, ultimately preventing dirigibles from ever docking there."
1358	16191	6	3	"The Empire State Building is one of the greatest symbols of the United States. With the World Trade Center destroyed, it stands as the city's highest building. Many are familiar with its famous spire at its summit, but few actually know why it's there. The truth is that it was meant to be a mooring dock for dirigibles, or zeppelins, balloons lined with steel that were equipped with propellers for steering.  The sad truth is that it never happened. According to the article ""The Mooring Mast"", the environmental conditions as well as safety condition, were too poor to accommodate. Apparently, the wind currents at such a high altitude are fearsome, and if a blimp were to be tethered to the top, quite a great deal of strain would be placed on the building frame, which is time-consuming and costly to fix. Also, there would be no practical way to weigh down the balloon without the risk of it falling on civilians. Not only that, but having air ships that low over urban areas was illegal due to safety concerns and airspace regulations. In short, the whole idea was wishful thinking, because it simply couldn't have happened."
1359	16192	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. For instance, in paragraph @NUM1 it talks about the Hindenburg bursting into flames over New Jersey + how much more dangerous it would have been over a highly populated area such as New York, especially considering the strong winds often encountered at such a great height, which could have made maneuvering the massive airships incredibly difficult and hazardous. This ultimately contributed to the abandonment of the ambitious plan.
1360	16193	6	3	During any type of construction, the builders face some type of obstacles, as did the builders of the Empire State Building. One obstacle the builders faced in attempting to let dirigibles dock on the Empire State building is the high flammability they have. A German dirigible was destroyed by fire in New Jersey, and if this would have happened in New York, with a more densely populated area, the accident would have been much worse, potentially causing numerous casualties. Another obstacle they faced, their greatest obstacle, was the power of nature. Air currents were violent, so the winds were constantly shifting and this would cause the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast, even if it was tethered to it, making docking extremely hazardous. One last obstacle they faced was an existing law that prevented airships to fly too low over urban areas, like New York, further complicating the practicality of the docking plan. Seeing the obstacles they faced, the builders realized that being able to moor a dirigible to the mast on top of the Empire State Building just was not meant to be.
1361	16194	6	3	"In ""The mooring mast"" by Marcia Lusted, builders who tried to make it possible for dirigibles or ""blimps"" to tie up to the mooring mast of the Empire State Building faced some problems they didn't account for. These were variations of blimps they didn't plan for, safety issues and also laws they would have to violate to have a dirigible land. The builders when making the mast didn't think deeply about any of these things. The problems the builders would face would appear right after the mast went up. To start, the differences in blimps between countries was a factor, because blimps in the United States used helium to keep the dirigible flying, but in places outside the states they used hydrogen which is flammable. This is a major issue for a place like New York that is densely populated, making the risk of fire unacceptably high. Another safety issue that they can't control was nature; the high winds atop the building would move the back of the blimp around, and also when landing the window may push the blimp into the mast which would puncture the dome, causing deflation. Both these safety reasons were why blimps are landed on the ground. However, even without both of these reasons there was a legal issue, a law that stated that airships can't fly too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal to dock on the building, further complicating the impractical plan. Having not considered all these things, the builders put up the mast but unfortunately they would later have to face the differences in blimps, safety issues and legal troubles they didn't account for, ultimately rendering the mooring mast a largely unused feature of the iconic skyscraper."
1362	16195	6	3	The Empire State building was built to compete with the Chrysler building, and to compete they created a mooring mast. The obstacles that restricted the dirigibles was nature; the wind changes on top of the building were drastic. Also, some dirigibles had a large amount of hydrogen, which is highly flammable, posing a significant risk. Another reason why was because it's illegal for aircrafts to fly low over urban areas, making the mooring mast concept impractical. The examples above were all complications that restricted the dirigibles to moor at the Empire State building, and ultimately led to the abandonment of the mooring mast's intended purpose.
1363	16196	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon, the challenges of creating a Mooring mast on top of a 1,250 foot tall building are discussed. In the 1920's Al Smith, the governor at the time, had the idea of making the Empire State Building equipped with its own landing dock for Dirigibles. Throughout the process the builders were faced with many obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. The first obstacle was getting the mast on top of the building. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" (Amidon). If the builders did do that it would cause too much stress to the building. The problem was solved after spending over $400,000 on a steel frame to support the mast. However, most of the builders problems were not able to be solved. Safety was a major issue, most dirigibles were built with hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. It would be a huge problem if a fire occurred over a densely populated area. Also the dirigibles would be too high up to be tied down securely. Furthermore, if the dirigibles did land there it would be in violation of an existing law. Therefore the builders were faced with so many obstacles they were ultimately unable to fully realize the ambitious vision of a functional mooring mast."
1364	16197	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building face obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to land there. One major obstacle was safety, mainly because when foreign dirigibles flew in, they most likely contained hydrogen (highly flammable). After the Hindenburg crash they were more wary if something like that happened in a densely populated area. An unstoppable obstacle to the builders was nature; with the vicious winds getting tied up in releasing passengers would be hard enough. According to the article lead weights were used to land dirigibles in open land on crappy weather, but the builders didn't use them, so there was no chance of it falling and hitting someone. Through all this trouble the builders still had the most practical problem; ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" With this issue it was illegal to have a dirigible tied up on the Empire State Building so close to the ground, making the entire endeavor legally dubious from the start. In conclusion, even though the mooring mast never worked out as planned, the builders went through looking at obstacles just for the thought."
1365	16198	6	3	"The competitive spirit of Al Smith, governor of New York, drove him and his architects to build a docking site for dirigibles atop the Empire State Building. Instead of seeing the daunting task which lay ahead, they saw the opportunity to become the epitome of modern travel. When deciding to build a mooring on top of the Empire State Building, the architects knew they'd face multiple obstacles. The first obstacle they faced with how to adjust the frame of the building to support the docking site. The architects knew that the building ""would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation"" (par. @NUM1). They were able to overcome this obstacle but many more loomed up ahead. The wind and weather needed to be taken into consideration as well. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting"" (par. @NUM2), making docking a hazardous maneuver. Reluctantly the builders admitted to the inevitable obstacle posed by nature. The builders seems to realize how unrealistic this dream was. Two more obstacles lay ahead, and these would lay the mooring dock to rest forever. A floating dirigible above a densley populated city was an all around dangerous idea. It was noticed that hydrogen was highly flammable (par. @NUM3) and a fire would be detrimental to both the building and the city. The last obstacle they faced was the law, and they were unable to conquer this. They realized that there ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (par @NUM4), making the entire endeavor illegal. The impossibility of the plan was realized for there were too many obstacles to face. The builders gave up hope but the moorings still looms atop the Empire State Building as a reminder of what could have been."
1366	16199	6	3	"The early 1930's was a time where everyone was out to find and build the next best thing. In New York, two tycoons were competing to build the tallest building in the world. Al Smith, the man creating the Empire State building, had an idea to make his building taller and more popular; build a mooring mast for dirigibles on the top of his building. Though a good and creative idea, the obstacles his architects would face would turn out to be more than they bargained for. First off, putting a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building was very unpracticle without changing the whole design. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and Strengthened to accommodate this new situation"", (Weigold 23). Also, the dirigible would put so much stress on the foundation of the building. ""The Stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation...,"" (Weigold 23). Nature was also a giant obsitacl these architects faced while building this. ""The greatest obstical to the suceessful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"", (Weigold 25). The high winds and unpredictable weather at that altitude made docking a dirigible incredibly dangerous and nearly impossible. As you can see, these architects faced many challenges while building this mast, that saddly never paid off in the end. The impracticality and danger ultimately led to the abandonment of the dirigible mooring mast concept, demonstrating that even the most innovative ideas can be thwarted by unforeseen realities."
1367	16200	6	3	The obstacles the builder of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are, The government people in Washington were thinking about some safe way of mooring airships to the mast. He never wanted them to reach the top because he didn't want an accident to happen and then something bad to occur. The wind on top of the building was constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The weights of the build meant it would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, so it was neither practical nor safe. It was also against the law, making the docking plan ultimately impossible.
1368	16201	6	3	"In order to dock these dirigibles, the builders would face many serious problems. These problems in which builders would be forced to deal with is when a city, and framework. First off, the building frame was too weak to tied to a dirigible. This is because it ""would add stress"" to the frame which could ""be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" Due to this they would be forced to spend ""over sixty thousand dollars"" to strengthen the frame, a considerable expense. A second issue the were faced with is that it is in a city. Laws had prohibited ""flying too low over urban areas"", let alone ""tie up to the building"", presenting legal and logistical hurdles. Due to this fact, they would be forced to design a way for it to dock while adhering to these restrictions. Finally, ""violent air currents"" would cause more issues. The builders would have to deal with building a piece mooring equipment that could with stan the wrath of ""nature itself"", requiring robust and weather-resistant designs. All in all, this plan would force many issues on the builders, in order to function, making the project complex and expensive to realize."
1369	16202	6	3	Right from the start, the Empire State Building had architectural demands that posed several obstacles for the builders of it, especially when it came to building the mooring mast for dirigibles. Initially, the Empire State Building was built only for inside use, so the mast would add stress to the buildings frame and possibly damage it, requiring extensive structural modifications. Secondly, the Empire State Building was built in a very densely populated area so if any malfunctions were to occur such as the Hindenburg in 1937, many people could be killed down below, creating an unacceptable safety risk. Another problem posed to the mooring mast was nature itself. Winds on top of the building were constantly shifting, and they were very strong as well so any dirigible mounting on the building was threatened by swiveling and flying off when landing, rendering docking incredibly hazardous. The masters in the architectural era had made a true mistake when they planned the construction of the Empire State Building, and it never could have reached its potential for many obvious reasons.
1370	16203	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while trying to make a for dirigibles. The first obstacle was creating the mooring mast. In @CAPS1 four it says, ""This dream of the aviation pioneers was travel by dirigible, or zepplin, and the Empire State Building was going to have a mooring mast at its top for docking these new airships."" The Empire State Building's frame wasn't strong enough for the mooring mast, so the builders had to modify it. In @CAPS1 nine they say, ""The steel frame of the Empire state Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" An obstacle that stopped the use of the mooring mast was the wind. In @CAPS1 fifthteen they were not able to dock, ""the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. another obstacle they faced was safty. In @CAPS1 @NUM1 they describe that, ""most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. These challenges, stemming from structural limitations, environmental factors, and safety concerns, ultimately rendered the mooring mast concept impractical."
1371	16204	6	3	The builders faced some problems such as weather conditions; the winds were violent from changing wind currents, which could make mooring the blimp difficult. Another was the law of how close an aircraft could be to a building, limiting potential locations. Another problem was the building had to be strong enough to hold a blimp in place. The builders would have to strengthen the building's skeleton in order for it to work; they successfully reinforced the structure. Another problem is some foreign blimps are made with hydrogen, making them highly flammable, while others are made of helium. The hydrogen could catch fire and fall onto pedestrians, posing a significant safety risk. These were the considerable problems they faced in making the blimp mooring viable.
1372	16205	6	3	Some of the obstacles that the builders faced while allowing dirigibles to dock there would be that they had a lack of suitable landing area. One of the main obstacles that occurred would be nature, specifically the weather conditions. The shifting of the Air Currents were constantly shifting, making approach and docking maneuvers difficult. The back of the ship was constantly shifting, which posed challenges for securing the airship safely to the mooring mast.
1373	16206	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building made it possible for dirigibles to dock on the top of the building. It lost its position as the biggest building and then got it back by creating the dock for dirigibles (blimps). This docking feature, though ultimately impractical, briefly restored its title as the world's tallest.
1374	16207	6	3	"In The Mooring Mask by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State building faced problems trying to dock the dirigibles. One big obstacle is that the dirigibles were a safety hazard. For example ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" If a dirigible had caught on fire while docked in such a highly populated area many people could have been killed. The possibility of even a small spark causing an explosion was a serious concern. Another issue was nature, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would cause the back of the dirigible to swivel around, making it unsafe. Attempting to control a massive airship in such turbulent conditions was extremely risky. The builders faced many obstacles and unfortunately could never dock a dirigible at the Empire State building."
1375	16208	6	3	In the building of the mast that was to be used to dock and refuel dirigibles the builders and architects faced many daunting problems. For one thing a simple mooring mast could not be placed on the roof of the Empire State Building. The mast would add too much stress to the building's framework and cause it to collapse, along with the immense wind power. Another problem was that most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium to inflate their dirigibles. Unlike helium, hydrogen is highly flammable, posing a significant safety risk in a densely populated area. There was also a law that stated that airships could not fly too low over urban areas, restricting the approach and maneuverability of the massive airships. One of the final and most important reasons builders overcame obstacles was the constantly shifting wind due to violent air currents. Even with the dirigibles tethered to the mooring mast, the back end would swivel around the mast along with the wind, making docking a precarious and challenging endeavor. These factors combined to create a complex engineering and safety puzzle.
1376	16209	6	3	There are many obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. one issue was the stress the dirigible would add to the building. over sixty thousand dollars in modifications had to be made to the building's framework to reinforce the structure. Also, most dirigibles contained hydrogen, which is highly flammable and dangerous. The risk of explosion was a serious concern. Another dangerous aspect is that this huge piece of material would be dangling high above pedestrians, as opposed to their much safer usual landing in open fields, posing a significant safety risk. Lastly, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which would also cause docking issues and potentially violate airspace regulations. These combined factors ultimately made the dirigible docking plan impractical.
1377	16210	6	3	The biggest obstacle was safety. The foreign dirigibles use Hydrogen (@NUM1) gas as a means to fly, but hydrogen gas is highly flammable. The owners of the Empire State Building were concerned because of what happened to the German dirigible, Hindenburg, over Lakehurst, @LOCATION2. The Hindenburg burst into flames, and in less than one minute, there was no dirigible, just some charred scrap metal. If this incident were to happen in a highly populated area like downtown New York City, it would create a high number of casualties and fatalities, making safety the paramount concern.
1378	16211	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there because of ""nature itself"" and the past problems that happened. An obstacle that the builders faced was providing safety. After the Hindenburg disaster, which occurred in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the builders were worried about the potential safety issues that might occur, especially when it takes place in downtown New York. Another obstacle was ""nature itself."" Because of the mooring mast being on top of the building, the builders were frightened because of the violent air currents at that height. The last obstacle was that it was a law that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. So it was effectively illegal for an airship to be tied to a building. The builders faced three main obstacles - ""Nature itself,"" a past accident, and the law. Unfortunately, they were unable to continue their work because the obstacles were just too strong, ultimately rendering the dirigible docking plan unfeasible."
1379	16212	6	3	"Allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building would have been completely different from anything before, but never continued because of obstacles. The builders faced issues such as safety issues, harnessing nature, and the law itself. The dirigibles presented safety issues including fire, which occurred and builders ""realized how much worse that accident could have been"" (∂ @NUM1). Another safety issue was keeping the blimps stabilized, which would have needed free hanging weights over the city, adding to the potential danger. Yet another obstacle was the power of nature; it would have been nearly impossible to keep the dirigible in place, especially given the building's height. Because of the wind ""the back of the ship would swivel around... the mooring mast"" (∂ @NUM2), making docking a precarious endeavor. The new idea was a good one but the law also was against it, because of how low the blimp would be, posing a hazard to the surrounding area. As stated, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building..."" (∂ @NUM3). The masting moor of the Empire State Building caused too many obstacles for the project to be completed. Although it would have opened new doors for means of travel there were too many safety violation for it to be worth while."
1380	16213	6	3	"While attempting to build a mooring dock on top of the Empire State building, the builders had some problems to overcome. The winds in New York City were too strong to fly a dirigible in, one driver said ""the captain could not take his hands off the control levers."" So close to buildings in a dirigible was illegal for fear of crashing into ""sharp spires of other buildings in the area."" The mooring mast itself was another obstacle. The only way to prevent the dirigible from swinging violently was to put large lead weights on it, but that would not be practical over New York. In conclusion, docking a dirigible on the Empire State Building was too difficult and it never happened."
1381	16214	6	3	The builders had many obstacles while building the Empire State building. They had competition with the Chrysler building because of its height. Al Smith, the constructor of the Empire State, wanted to build the tallest and most famous building in the world. He made the buildings seem invincible. He even put a mooring mast on it, ostensibly so airships could dock there. But it was never supposed to serve that purpose; it was only created for publicity. Because of the mooring mast and Smith's determination, the building achieved renown and popularity. Al Smith did everything to make that building what it is today, and it is still standing in New York City today, a testament to his vision.
1382	16215	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced when trying to allow dirigibles to land there. One is that the weight of the zeppelin, when tied down to the building, would put immense pressure on the framework and the pressure even would have reached the foundation. The cost of reworking the frame work to make it safer would have been $2 million. Another obstacle was public expectations. The Building was supposed to change how we travel forever, all while being a beautiful, magnificent structure. Surely the pressure to build the tallest tower in the world got to them. These expectations were so unreal because most people didn't know enough to understand the safety risk involved. Ultimately, these challenges proved too difficult to overcome, and the dirigible landing platform was abandoned, showing that ambition must sometimes yield to practicality.
1383	16216	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced were not easy. They had to draw out the plan for the mooring mast meticulously. The builders had to think about the thousand-foot dirigible that would be mooring at the top of the Empire State Building, considering its size and weight. They had to think about the wind pressure and the load of the dirigible on the structure. The builders had to come up with brilliant ideas to address these challenges. The ideas included ""a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower"" on top of the building. Builders had to build and think of the elevators and stairs required to bring the passengers of the dirigible to the eighty-sixth floor. The eighty-sixth floor was planned to handle baggage and tickets. Passengers would arrive from the one hundred second floor. The builders had a hard job because they had to think of ideas on how to build the mooring mast of the building effectively. They also had to think about how to bring the passengers in and out of the dirigible safely and efficiently. The builders faced significant obstacles as the construction of the building was in process, requiring innovative solutions and careful planning to realize the ambitious vision."
1384	16217	6	3	"The Empire State Building at the time it was being built was designed to be the tallest building in the world. However this was not an easy task. The workers had one especially difficult obstacle overcome, dirigibles, or blimps, to dock there. The plan was to build a mooring mast on top of the building which would allow dirigibles to dock. If this could be achieved it was said to make the Empire State Building, ""equipped for an age of transportation..."" However many problems occurred. The dirigibles weight would have to be able to be held safely. The architects knew the weight would put stress on the buildings frame, especially with the high altitude winds. The workers had to modify and strengthen the buildings framework to accommodate these stresses. The workers also built the mast out of a strong, shiny, chrome-nickel alloy to withstand the elements. Another obstacle was faced when the mast was taken in consideration. The framework was originally stopped at the eighty-fifth floor. The workers had to finish the roof before the mast could be framed, adding significant time to the construction. Although the workers succeeded on making a safe mast, the ""Aviation Pioneers Dream"" never came to be, proving to be impractical due to strong winds and logistical difficulties."
1385	16218	6	3	"Al Smith envisioned the Empire State Building as more than just a skyscraper. He saw an opportunity to integrate it with air travel, proposing a mooring mast atop the building for dirigibles. These airships could then anchor for refueling, servicing, and passenger transfer. Realizing this ambition, however, required significant alterations to the building's structure. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be ""modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation,"" costing over sixty thousand dollars in framework modifications. Builders were tasked with raising the building to 102 floors and adding a glassed-in observation area, alongside an open observation platform. The roof had to be completed before the steel mast, complete with glass windows, could be erected. Despite the time and money invested in re-engineering the building, the dirigible docking concept proved impractical. The strong winds at that height made it impossible to stabilize the airships, causing the back of the ship to move constantly. Furthermore, regulations restricted airships from flying too low over urban areas. Ultimately, the vision of airships docking at the Empire State Building was abandoned, proving the costly modifications to be futile in the end."
1386	16219	6	3	"Due to several factors, the Empire State Building faced many obstacles trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One serious obstacle was that the dirigible moored at the top of the building, held only by a tether, would stress the building's frame. In paragraph nine, it says ""the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the framework."" This was a considerable expense undertaken to address the structural integrity concerns. Another complication was nature itself. Above the city were strong winds, which were constantly shifting due to air currents. This made it impossible to dock safely and reliably. As well as nature working against the mooring mast, so was the law. In paragraph fifteen, it says ""on existing law against airships flying too low over low urban areas,"" which made it illegal for an airship to ever tie up to the Empire State Building. These combined challenges ultimately rendered the ambitious dirigible docking plan impractical and unfeasible."
1387	16220	6	3	"The Empire State Building faced a lot of obstacles, like in paragraph @NUM1, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" This was one of the many troubles there was for dirigibles to land on the Empire State building. In paragraph @NUM2, they CAme to realize that the mooring mast of the Empire State Building wasn't of been build, because it wouldn't work."" The Mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfil it's purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed. The reason that mooring mast was because of nature. As you will see on paragraph @NUM3, ""the winds were shifting due to violent air currents."" The mooring mast had a lot of problems since the beginning when Al Smith put a top to the building making it 1,250 feet. It was unsafe for planes. When they wanted to make the Dirigibles land on top of the building, Dirigibles that came from other countries had hydrogen, which is highly flammable. The problem that worked against the mooring mast being built was wind on top of the building. Because of the air currents. These are the reasons why the mooring mast was unsuccessful on the Empire State Building, ultimately rendering the grand vision of aerial docking impractical and highlighting the power of natural forces against human ambition."
1388	16221	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were that the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether would have stressed the building's frame, as the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below, thus presenting a significant engineering challenge to overcome.
1389	16222	6	3	When the Empire State Building was built, new ideas came into the heads of the architects. Unfortunately, the vision that they had of making it into a dock for blimps proved to be unrealistic. The first challenge that they came across was how to attach a dock for a blimp to the building without creating such stress to the building's framework. The building could potentially collapse with the added weight unless sixty thousand dollars' worth of framework strengthening was made. Another obstacle that the architects faced was nature; the high altitude presented difficulties. At the top of the Empire State Building, winds were so strong that the blimps would be swaying too violently to allow for the pilots to dock them safely. The last reason that blimps could not be docked at the Empire State Building was that there were laws against aircraft's flying that low. It was actually considered illegal to dock the blimp there because it would have to be flying low enough to approach the building. Due to these factors, the ambitious plan was abandoned, and the Empire State Building was unable to become a dock to support blimps.
1390	16223	6	3	From my reading, I understand that the difficulties of building a mooring dock atop such a structure as the Empire State Building were numerous. An obvious one was structural stability throughout the entire building; the tension from the dirigible pulling on the tether would cause stress on the building's frame. Another was control of the dirigible during docking, since the winds above the Empire State Building would shift violently and frequently, making maneuvers precarious. Safety was also a significant issue, especially after the Hindenburg accident in New Jersey, when a German zeppelin caught fire and exploded, raising serious concerns about the viability and risks of lighter-than-air travel to such a location.
1391	16224	6	3	The obstacles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building were building a mast suitable for mooring, the challenge of actually having dirigibles successfully dock on top of the building, and ultimately, the impact of a law that affected dirigible operations. The architects and builders spent a lot of time and resources building the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, hoping it would become a popular transportation hub. Dirigibles were actively trying to figure out the best and safest way to dock to the building, yet most dirigibles failed in their attempts due to strong winds and technical difficulties. A law that prohibited dirigibles from docking in urban areas due to safety concerns, particularly the potential for accidents within the dirigibles, further hindered the project. These were the significant obstacles the builders faced in their ambitious attempt to create a functional mast and facilitate dirigible docking atop the Empire State Building, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the project.
1392	16225	6	3	"The obstacles the builders faced building the Empire State Building were the safety and the time. The safety of building the top of the Empire State Building got in the way because it was so tall that it would be hard to lift up the glass and steel parts to the top. Another reason why it was unsafe was because if some of the glass or steel parts got pushed off, the people down below could be hurt. There was also the concern of blimps flying too close to the buildings and hitting them. Furthermore, with passengers going on and off of the blimp, they needed to find a way to ensure the passengers wouldn't get hurt during the process. The time that they had to build the top of the Empire State Building was not long enough, adding pressure to the already complex and dangerous construction. The urgency to complete the building within the allotted timeframe amplified the challenges related to safety and logistics, making the entire endeavor a race against the clock with significant risks involved. ""it's on the level, all right. No Kidding. We're working on the thing now."""
1393	16226	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many CHALLENGES in trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders had a real hard time with this construction of the mooring mast. They had to deal with the frame work of the building. A big obstacle they had was that they didn't have a suitable landing area for the dirigibles. They didn't just have to deal with man made CHALLENGES, but nature's CHALLENGES as well. The wind on the top of the building made it nearly impassible to land safely. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation"" (AMERICAN HERITAGE CENTER 1). The constructors of the building realized that to make this plan possible they would have to redo the frame of the building. The building wasn't even designed to be able to allow dirigibles to land on the top of the building. The workers were blind to see all the possible problems with the design of the mooring mast. The CHALLENGES the workers had to go through were to much and the landing of the dirigibles never worked."
1394	16227	6	3	"to allow Dirigibles to **land** on the empire state **building**, builders would have to face tough obstacles. One obstacle would be that technology was growing in the 1930's by the time they were **finished** with the **Empire State Building**, and planes were invented.

Ultimately, the builders abandoned the plan, realizing the danger and impracticality, solidifying that dirigible landings were never truly feasible."
1395	16228	6	3	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building had to face a lot of obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle that the builders had to face was when they were building the mooring mast to hold the dirigibles. The single cable tether that would hold the dirigibles would add stress to the building's frame, requiring a strong and innovative solution. The builders had to come up with a new idea that would not put stress on the Building. Another obstacle the builders had to face is it would be safe for the passengers, particularly during the transfer from airship to building. Since the building is so high up, the fear of falling out of the dirigible made them worry about passenger safety. One last obstacle that the builders had to face is the ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" which presented a legal challenge. It made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building. The builders faced many obstacles while building the mooring mast, highlighting the ambitious and complex nature of the project."
1396	16229	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the building. The first obstacle was that the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified, as ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" Another obstacle was safety, especially considering the potential for disaster. After the German dirigible Hindenburg caught on fire, builders realized how bad the devastation would be if that happened over densely populated New York City. Nature was also a large obstacle because shifting air currents at the top of the building would make the dirigible very unstable. It would be dangerous to have an unstable dirigible hanging above crowded city streets. Finally, at the time there was an ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" further complicating the docking attempts. These obstacles ultimately deterred the architects of the Empire State Building from attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."
1397	16230	6	3	Builders of the Empire State Building faced a few problems when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there One problem was that a large dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by one single cable tether would add stress to the frame of the building. The stress of the dirigible and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted almost eleven hundred feet below, to the building's foundation. This in turn means that the builders would have to go back and modify the frame of the Empire State Building in order for it to be strong enough to accommodate the dirigibles. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications would have to be made to support this added weight and wind resistance. As construction proceeded, once the framing had been complete up to the 85th floor, the roof had to be completed before the framing for the mooring mast could take place, adding another layer of complexity to the already challenging construction timeline. Therefore, the complexities and costs associated with reinforcing the building's structure for dirigible mooring presented significant engineering and logistical hurdles.
1398	16231	6	3	"Some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were safety, nature and the law. One of the greatest obstacle was safety. Since blimps needed to be lighter than air, most are filled with helium or hydrogen. ""Most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION1 used hydrogen rather than helium and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This is a big obstacle because if the blimp is high off the ground of @CAPS1 and then catches on fire, that could end badly. Another obstacle was nature; due to violent air currents' which made buildings sway. This is also bad because if the blimp moves or the building sways into the building than one or the other could break, making docking incredibly risky. The last obstacle was the law, which was against 'airships flying too low over urban areas'. So if they did build the mast, it would be even illegal to get a dirigible close, rendering the docking station useless. So those are some obstacles builders faced in building the Empire State building to dock blimps, ultimately making the impractical idea impossible to implement."
1399	16232	6	3	"There were many obstacles the builders went through in trying to dock the dirigibles at the top of the Empire State Building. One to be exact would be the wind, although they would be tying the dirigible down the back was not and the wind would blow it decide. Which would affect the building. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" With this discovery they had to make some changes to the building, which would cost them more money. Other obstacles they went through were actually being able to have it dock, because it's a law that you can't do that with some people below. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" These are just a few of the obstacles that the architects went through out trying to dock dirigibles."
1400	16233	6	3	First of all the Empire State Building wasn't made for landing dirigibles on top of it. The architects had to redesign the whole top of the building. When they did that they never bothered to put proper landing gear down for the dirigibles. If it was a bad day out, weatherwise, then it would be very difficult to land a dirigible without the proper landing gear. The dirigible is over @NUM1 feet long, without a very large landing service, it would be dangerous for the people in the dirigible, the people on the ground, and the people helping land the dirigible, thus making the whole endeavor quite impractical.
1401	16234	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A problem they faced was having to build the mooring mast because without it the dirigible would add stress to the building's frame. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" Even though the builders made the mooring mast, it was too unsafe to moor dirigibles from the building. ""The greatest reason was one of safety: Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is very flammable."" Wind conditions at that height also proved to be a significant factor. In all, the builders were faced with too many obstacles and could not manage to moor the dirigibles to the building."
1402	16235	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were safety, existing laws, and the changes in air currents. Many of the dirigibles ""from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@NUM1). The owners of the Empire State Building realized that a much worse situation would happen if it were to catch on fire ""above a densely populated area"" (@NUM1), potentially causing catastrophic damage and loss of life. Another practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the top of the building was that there was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (@NUM3). The airship would be ""dangling high above pedestrians on the streets"", which is pretty unsafe (@NUM4), and would violate this legal restriction. The last obstacle that the builders faced was the shift in air currents on top of the building. If the dirigibles were tied to the mooring mast, ""the back of the ship would swivel around and around"" (@NUM4). This could be dangerous for pedestrians on the street, as well as passengers coming on and off the dirigibles, making the docking procedure highly precarious. These practical reasons called for the idea of the mooring mast to be diminished, rendering the ambitious plan ultimately unfeasible."
1403	16236	6	3	The obstacles that the Empire State Building faced were alot, so that the dirigibles; blimps could dock there. One obstacle was building more floors. They had to build more floors so that the people on the dirigibles could have somewhere to load and unload on the ship. Another obstacle was building steel frames from the 85th floor to the 102nd floor. This costed them over @MONEY1 worth of modifications, that had to be done to the building's framework, ultimately making the ambitious dirigible docking plan an impractical endeavor.
1404	16237	6	3	"@CAPS2 on the excerpt, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. This would cause stress on the building, so the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened, requiring significant engineering adjustments. Another obstacle the architects faced was a concern of safety. In the excerpt it says, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable,"" presenting a considerable risk in the heart of New York City. @CAPS1 the greatest obstacle was ""nature itself."" On the top of the building, the winds were constantly shifting because of the violent air currents. In the excerpt it states, ""the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" making docking maneuvers incredibly dangerous and impractical. @CAPS2 on the excerpt, these are the many obstacles faced by the architects, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan due to the combination of structural, safety, and environmental challenges."
1405	16238	6	3	The Empire State Building faced many problems. To dock a dirigible, it needed a good, safe dock site at its peak. Also, the wind so high up would make it nearly impossible for a dirigible to stay docked, constantly buffeting the airship. Finally, the dirigible would be very hazardous to the people below because it was extremely flammable, posing a significant risk in case of accidents. Thus, the impracticalities and dangers ultimately made the dirigible docking plan unfeasible.
1406	16239	6	3	"In the fascinating story ""The Mooring Mast"" written by author Marcia Amidon L¸sted, we learn about the Empire State Building and its enormous scale. Although constructing this building demanded considerable time and strength from the workers, they didn't fully grasp the purpose of the mooring mast. There were many reasons why they faced conflicts in attempting to let dirigibles dock at the mooring mast. For example, the dirigibles used helium rather than hydrogen, a highly flammable gas; docking with hydrogen in downtown New York City would have been a complete tragedy. Another reason is because dirigibles were typically moored in open landing fields, allowing them to be weighted down. Author Marcia writes, ""but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the streets was neither practical nor safe."" This illustrates one of the key challenges, and there were many more reasons why workers had trouble with the mooring mast concept, ultimately proving the impracticality of such an endeavor."
1407	16240	6	3	"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the Empire State Building faced some obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. To begin with, one of the greatest obstacle was the act of nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"", this made it hard for the dirigible to have a safer landing. The other obstacle was that there was a law, that went against airships flying low over urban areas. This regulation further complicated the feasibility of safely docking the large airships in the heart of New York City. In conclusion, the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was not use for landing airship such as the dirigible because it was to dangireous. In addition, they used the mooring mast for other safe purpuses."
1408	16241	6	3	In the beginning the use of dirigibles seemed like a good idea. They could be the new form of transportation and appeared to have no flaws. As the development of dirigibles progressed it showed signs of problems. The engineers planned on mooring the dirigible to the mast of the Empire State Building, but that would have added a lot of stress to the building's frame, threatening its structural integrity. They next found that safety was a major issue. Most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium which was flammable, posing a significant risk of explosion. Also they would have to use lead weights to hold down the dirigible when it was being moored. It would be very dangerous to have lead weights dangling over pedestrians on the street below. Without the lead weights, the dirigible would simply swivel uncontrollably in the air with a possibility of puncturing its delicate shell. Finally there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This made it effectively illegal for the ship to even approach the building for mooring. There were high hopes for the use of dirigibles, but in the end they had more cons than pros, ultimately making the concept impractical.
1409	16242	6	3	"In an attempt to build a dirigible destination in the Empire State Building, the architects had to deal with significant problems like a dirigible mishap or simply nature itself. Problems like a blimp crash would be costly; lives would be lost in the densely populated city, and the explosion could destroy buildings around and the Empire State Building itself. To prevent this from happening, the Government had already made a law that banned flying aircraft from going too close to urban areas. To build this mast, the architects would have to break laws or bend rules. Another conflicting idea that disrupted plans for a dirigible docking station would be nature; harsh winds could easily sway a blimp, and swaying could cause the blimp to puncture on a nearby building, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would still swivel around the mooring mast."" (Popular Science, 1930). The swiveling, as mentioned earlier, could hit nearby buildings and harm civilians. The potential problems and laws that kept the mast from being created should have been realized before; the idea will never be possible."
1410	16243	6	3	The Empire State building is known as the world's tallest building. The building is located in New York. Al Smith, the head of building the Empire State building, added a top or a hat to the building, that made the building be even more distinctive than any other building in the city. The Empire State building was equipped for transportation. The transportation was dirigible, or zeppelin. The Empire State building had a mooring mast at its top for docking the new airships. An obstacle that the Building faced was New York's lack of a suitable landing area. Al saw an opportunity to get people to and from the Empire state building. Al saw it as something creative and new. The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was never fulfilled. No thought of safety was thought about before constructing the idea either. The greatest reason was most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, which is a higher risk for flames. Also nature itself was a big problem, the idea had safety problems and couldn't withstand flames in Downtown New York. Ultimately, the impracticality and inherent dangers led to the abandonment of the airship mooring mast concept, highlighting the challenges of implementing innovative ideas without considering crucial safety and environmental factors.
1411	16244	6	3	Based on the excerpt the obstacles that the builders faced was that they had to go to the base of the building to make it taller. This necessity presented logistical challenges, requiring them to transport materials and equipment to the ground level before raising them again. Overcoming this constraint was crucial for the successful completion of the construction.
1412	16245	6	3	Many obstacles presented themselves while builders attempted to build a landing dock for dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building. The obstacles included the publics safety, regulations that were already put in place, and the unpredictable weather. Many dirigibles use hydrogen gas which is very flammable. After the German Hindenburg went down it became apparent that the publics safety would be in danger from the vessels bursting into flame over crowded streets. At the time there were also regulations forbidding aircrafts from traveling too low over urban areas and the landing dock was too low. The final problem was the unpredictable weather. Pilots were worried the strong winds would blow the tethered vessel into another building or into sharp spires that would ruin the vessel and put the people below in danger. Many obstacles hindered the loading dock on the Empire State Building, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the project.
1413	16246	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were high wind currents, and an already existing law that was against airships flying too low over urban areas. The first reason dirigibles couldn't dock was because of overly powered wind currents on top of the Empire State Building. It was mentioned that ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe."" The point being made here was that it would be unsafe for people if the dirigibles were going to dock near the Empire State during violent air currents. The other reason why dirigibles couldn't dock was because of the law saying they were against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for the ships to tie up to the building and even get to close to the area. It was said that dirigibles did try to reach the building. ""In December 1930 the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. Fearing that the wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area which would puncture the dirigible's shell, the captain could not even take his hands off the control levers."" Since the dirigible was so big it couldn't get close enough because of sharp objects on other buildings. It is clear that the builders of the Empire State Building went through challenging obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. All because of very violent wind or air currents and the already existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."
1414	16247	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many different obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. The major obstacle to allow dirigibles to dock there was the lack of a suitable landing area. To allow dirigibles to anchor at Empire State Building for several hours, a mooring mast had to be added to the top of the building. The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof, so rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside. Once architects had designed the mooring mast it could be complete and useful. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. Ultimately, these challenges were overcome through innovative design and engineering, though the mooring mast's intended use was hampered by weather conditions. Those are some of the obstacles the builders had to face to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building.
1415	16248	6	3	"After planning and building the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, the developers found many problems that were not thought of earlier. They hadn't considered the flammability of the gases inside of the dirigibles. Nor had they remembered the ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to a building"" (lines @NUM1). Also, the heavy winds that would be found that high above the ground would certainly prove to be a danger to all the airships attempting to moor. If they had hit a neighboring building the results could be disastrous, especially considering the volatile gases contained within the airships. These oversights ultimately rendered the mooring mast impractical, highlighting the crucial need for comprehensive risk assessment in ambitious construction projects."
1416	16249	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem the builders faced was that a dirigible being moored to the top of the building would add stress to its frame. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly @NUM2 feet below."" The builders had to make sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to strengthen the frame of the building. Another major problem they faced was safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium."" Hydrogen is extremely flammable and after an incident with a German dirigible being destroyed, they realized how dangerous it would be over a densely populated area. Another reason was nature. In paragraph @NUM3 it says ""The winds on top of the building were constantly moving."" This made it hard to tie up and keep the aircraft steady for passengers to get off safely. Even a navy pilot ""could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" There was even a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The mooring on top of the Empire State building was destined to fail because of all the obstacles that the builders faced. Due to these issues concerning structural integrity, safety hazards, and uncontrollable environmental factors, the ambitious project of mooring dirigibles to the Empire State Building was ultimately impractical."
1417	16250	6	3	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders went through obstacles to allow the dirigibles to dock in the Empire State Building, the builders had to redesign the top of the Empire State Building. They had to make it taller and more suitable for the dirigibles to land. They went through problems because they were not sure if the dirigibles would fit. Second, they had to design the mast. The builders had to design a whole other part for the dirigible. The builders also had to spend sixty thousand dollars into building the mast, a significant sum at the time. The builders faced that big obstacle. Third, the builders also made a stainless steel tower for the docking of the dirigibles. This was an obstacle because they had glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel on the tower, requiring specialized construction techniques. The builders went through many obstacles for the dirigibles to dock, when in the end the dirigibles never did get a chance to dock. The builders should ""Take a bow, because it's over now."""
1418	16251	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles allowing dirigibles to dock there like safety, nature, and existing law. In the excerpt the author tells how many dirigibles use hydrogen which is very flammable. That makes it very dangerous to dock them on the Empire State Building because they could get in an accident, and since New York is so densely populated it would probably harm many people. People's lives shouldn't be risked just to land a dirigible. Another problem builders face was nature. In paragraph 3 the excerpt states ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would mean the dirigible would just be dangling way above New York and winds could get dangerous very fast because it was so unpredictable. According to the excerpt this was neither practical nor safe. To add to all of these obstacles builders didn't consider an already existing law that is against airships flying too low over urban areas. So that meant it would be illegal to dock a dirigible on the Empire State Building. Builders faced so many obstacles about allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building it just wasn't meant to be."
1419	16252	6	3	"While builders tried to figure out a way for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, there were some obstacles faced. If a dirigible was held by a single cable, this would add stress to the building's frame. The dirigible would have to be cabled at the top which was also difficult because of the Empire State's flat roof. Also weather was a huge obstacle. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1, line @NUM2) The wind would cause the dirigible to sway and not be very stable. Builders had to also keep in mind that using the building could be harmful to pedestrians as well, the dirigibles would be too close to the ground. The planning of where these aircrafts to land and re-fill was not an easy task for the builders, and considering all these challenges, it is clear why the dirigible docking plan was ultimately abandoned."
1420	16253	6	3	"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, nature, unsafe docking conditions and pre-existing laws against dirigibles were just a few obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced. The main obstacle ""to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"". On the top of a building so high the wind is always switching directions which would cause the dirigible to ""swivel around"". Blimps or dirigibles always landed in open fields and could be weighted down with lead weights, but using this technique ""where they would be dangling high above pedestrians... was neither practical nor safe"". This raised concerns about the safety of people both on the airship and below. The builders of the Empire State Building also came across ""an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas"". Now this law made it illegal for any airship to dock or tie up to the building. In conclusion, attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was neither safe, practical or legal."
1421	16254	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building had many obstacles they had to face in order to fulfill the vision. The Empire State Building is 1,250 feet tall which made for some problems. L¸sted stated, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the Mooring Mast was nature itself. The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The wind speed on the top of the Empire State building would be terrible because the Dirigible's tail is basically weightless and it would move around violently which could make the support beams give out, or could put people's life in danger below. L¸sted said, ""But using these at the Empire State Building; where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street is neither practical nor safe."" Another reason as to why the Mooring Mast can not be constructed is the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. L¸sted stated, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to a building or even approach the area."" It is not legal for the Dirigible to even be in the viscinity of the building which makes it impossible to do, thus rendering the Mooring Mast concept unfeasible."
1422	16255	6	3	"The future of transportation is a matter that any architect has discussed at one point. Whether reality is taken into account, that is another subject. Al Smith had the challenge of making the dream of docking dirigibles into a reality. Although Smith had high hopes for the project, many obstacles stood in the way of the construction of the dock. One problem is stated in paragraph fourteen, ""the greatest obstacle to a sucsesful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Wind power was not taken into account at the time, and neither was the fact that thousands of people in downtown New York were put in danger. In conclusion, dirigibles soon became much more useless with the spark of the airplane and soon died along with the dreams of the mooring mast. Another problem that stood in the way was a law stating that airships cannot fly too close to urban areas. This destroyed any plans of the mast because not only was it risky to build, but it was also illegal. What was once a glimpse of the future soon turned into nothing as @PERSON1 finally confronted the public in saying that the construction will be post-poned. The future of transportation took a sharp blow, but with the new succession of the airplane, anything seemed possible."
1423	16256	6	3	The Empire State Building was in construction, and the building passed many obstacles. First, because they wanted to do the biggest build in the world, they had to work hard and overcome logistical challenges. The State building was destined to never fulfill its purpose for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed, as the Great Depression loomed, threatening its economic viability. Ultimately, while ambitious, the Empire State Building's success was far from guaranteed given the economic climate.
1424	16257	6	3	"Despite all hope and anticipation surrounding the construction of the mooring mast atop the Empire State Building, the project was never destined to be a success. In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, there are many obstacles described that the builders faced as they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock on the mast. The first major obstacle that the builders came upon was that when a dirigible was mounted onto the mooring ""the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"". This obstacle caused the need for an abundance of extra support on the frame needed to maintain sturdiness of the building. The frame required extensive reinforcements to handle the immense weight and potential swaying of the airship. The other, and arguably greatest obstacle that the builders faced were the rapid wind currents that surrounded the building. The winds caused problems for the dirigible because ""even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"". This caused a major design flaw for the builders in the way that they would have to maintain control and safety of the dirigible as it was docked by the mooring. Passengers also would have had great difficulty disembarking in such conditions. As much as the plan dwarfed others of its time, it was short-lived. The plan had far too many obstacles to overcome and serves better today as a memorable characteristic of the Empire State building."
1425	16258	6	3	Obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were problems such as strong winds, a weak structure, and public safety. The strong winds at that altitude would almost make it impossible to hold a massive airship steady at the top of the building. The weak structure, not initially designed for the immense weight and stress of docking dirigibles, would almost make it impossible to hold them safely at the top. With all of these hazards, it is completely unsafe for people to ride, dock, and board these massive dirigibles at the top of the Empire State Building, rendering the ambitious docking plan ultimately impractical.
1426	16259	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced significant obstacles in their ambitious attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major concern was the structural stress that a thousand-foot dirigible docking would place on the building's foundation. A dirigible moored to the building's mast, held by a single cable, would transmit its load and the wind pressure all the way down, potentially compromising the building's structural integrity. Furthermore, the inherent dangers of dirigible operations, especially above a densely populated area, were a serious consideration. The Hindenburg disaster in Lakehurst, New Jersey, highlighted the potential for catastrophic accidents and made the owners realize the devastating consequences if such an event occurred above downtown New York. The strong and unpredictable winds at the top of the building also posed a formidable challenge. These winds, characterized by violent air currents, would cause a tethered dirigible to swivel uncontrollably around the mooring mast. Ultimately, these significant obstacles proved insurmountable, and the initial vision of dirigibles docking atop the Empire State Building never came to fruition.
1427	16260	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"", the author, Marcia Amidon L¸sted, is informant on the structural and natural obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building. One obstacle faced by the builders was involved with the structure of the building itself. The issue was that a moored dirigible, or blimp, would add a significant amount of stress to the building's frame, potentially compromising its integrity. To fix this problem, the ""frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened,"" requiring additional steel and engineering expertise. Another obstacle faced by the builders involved nature and the unpredictable elements. The winds on top of the building were violent and often shifted directions, making it difficult to control a massive airship. This hindered the ability of a dirigible to moor on top of the building and remained a problem that was hard to solve. The final obstacle faced was a restriction on the flight of airships over urban areas, due to safety concerns and air traffic regulations. This restriction made it impossible for dirigibles to moor on top of the Empire State Building, essentially rendering the mooring mast concept impractical. The excerpt explains the structural and natural obstacles faced by the builders, revealing how these challenges ultimately prevented the Empire State Building from serving as a functional airship terminal."
1428	16261	6	3	During the process of building the Empire State Building, the builders had to go through obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on it. Some of these obstacles were changing the design of the building, thinking about the safety of people, and the material the dirigibles were made of. Since a thousand-foot dirigible that moored at the top of the building would add stress to the building's frame, the steel frame of the building would have to be modified and strengthened, increasing the building's overall cost. Over sixty thousand dollars work of modifications had to be spent to support this ambitious concept. A dirigible was a steel framed balloon with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium. This was a safety issue; Most dirigibles used hydrogen, rather than helium, and hydrogen is very flammable, posing a severe risk. A German dirigible was destroyed by fire, and the owners of the Empire State Building realized how bad an accident like that could be over downtown New York, a densely populated area. Therefore, during construction of the Empire State Building, builders had to go through many obstacles just to attempt to allow dirigible to dock there, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the project due to safety concerns and logistical difficulties.
1429	16262	6	3	The builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 faced many obstacals when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. A thousand-foot dirigible at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether would put stress on the building's frame. The steel frame of the building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework. Theese are the obstacals they had to @ORGANIZATION1 overcome to realize their vision.
1430	16263	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced mirrored the challenges encountered by passengers on existing transatlantic routes and anticipated on new routes that were yet to come, reflecting the era's ambition to conquer both vertical and horizontal distances. Just as engineers grappled with wind loads and material science to erect the skyscraper, travelers and aviation pioneers contended with the uncertainties of weather and navigation, each pushing the boundaries of what was then thought possible. The parallel pursuit of height and speed underscored a shared spirit of innovation and a relentless drive to overcome limitations, ultimately shaping the future of both urban skylines and global travel.
1431	16264	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some minor obstacles were the frame and strength of the building. Other obstacles were major such as nature which cannot be controlled. In paragraph nine the author explains that if a thousand-foot dirigibles were to be moored to the top of the Empire State Building it would add stress to the building's frame. Also with wind pressure the building's foundation would be affected. In order to allow dirigibles to dock, the frame of the building would have to be modified and strengthened. As nature as a great affect on the use of the mooring mast it would be almost impossible for dirigibles to be tethered onto the building. The wind would send the dirigibles swiveling around the mooring mast as the author describes in paragraph fourteen. Other obstacles the builders faced were most dirigibles from outside the U.S used hydrogen rather than helium, most landing fields weighed down the back of the blimps would lead weight (which wouldn't be safe to have dangling over pedestrians), the last problem was there was an existing law againts airships flying low over urban areas. The builders also encountered logistical problems, such as safely transferring passengers and cargo from the dirigible to the building. Though the builders of the Empire State building faced obstacles in allowing blimps to dock it still became a well known building in New York City.
1432	16265	6	3	Some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced were that inside the dirigibles were hydrogen, which is highly flammable. The builders did not want to risk any lives or damage any buildings given the potential for explosions. They realized how much worse an accident could be if it took place in down town New York, considering the density of people and structures. The greatest obstacle was the wind on top of the building. The winds were constantly shifting due to air currents, making docking a large airship incredibly dangerous. Also dirigibles would be dangling over pedestrians on the streets below, posing a significant safety hazard. The last reason is because their was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for them to tie it up to the building or even approach it, effectively ending the dirigible docking plan. Thus, the plan to use the Empire State Building as a dirigible port was ultimately abandoned due to safety concerns and legal restrictions.
1433	16266	6	3	"When the architects behind the mooring mast of the Empire State Building first began their work in designing it, they did not take into account the **stresses** that they would have to overcome to dock a dirigible. In the excerpt it states that the mooring mast was not originally part of the design structure for the Empire State Building; however, the stresses it would cause in docking a dirigible ""would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" This means that the builders would need to design some way of doing this when the building was already begun. Other **challenges** included those of safety. The excerpt tells that ""most dirigibles from outside the U.S. used hydrogen,"" which is more flammable than helium. This, combined with the fact that there really was no way of securing the tail of a dirigible moored at the mast, could cause an accident **similar** to that of the Hindenburg over a ""densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Therefore, the structural and safety concerns ultimately proved too significant to overcome."
1434	16267	6	3	"It shows in some ways there were obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles or blimps to dock there. One of those examples was found in paragraph @NUM1. It said ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was designed to never fulfill its purpose."" Another one was also in paragraph @NUM1 when they said ""The greatest reason was one of safety: Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by a fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Also in paragraph @NUM3 it says that nature was a big obstacle for the success of the mooring mast, because the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Existing laws prohibiting airships from flying too low over populated or urban areas further complicated the plan. Therefore, a combination of practical design flaws, safety concerns regarding flammable hydrogen, unpredictable weather conditions, and legal restrictions ultimately prevented the Empire State Building’s mooring mast from ever being used as intended."
1435	16268	6	3	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted there were important obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced for the dirigibles to dock and becomes stationary there. The dirigible was highly flammable, struchure was unsafe laws and it was @CAPS4 prmitting for them to dock There. One, The dirigibles are highly flammable to have have near a building that has so much importance to its @CAPS1. ""Today These dirigibles are camo. fabric filled with hydrogen and helium to have lighter in the air."" These dirigibles in the U.S only have hydrogen which is the ultimate firestarter. Second, the structure never passed for a human passenger to get on The structure and ride The blimp. The law states ""aircraft flying low to urban areas is @CAPS2."" @CAPS3 why it never could happen. Third, @CAPS4 can never always be right twenty-four seven. The problem is ""winds on top of the building were constantly shifting violent air currents."" This Put lives in @CAPS5, these were obstacles in The dirigibles docking. The sheer impracticality of safely docking such large and volatile airships, combined with legal and structural issues, ultimately prevented the mooring mast from ever functioning as intended, demonstrating how ambition can be thwarted by the realities of safety and logistics."
1436	16269	6	3	"Builders of the Empire State building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A mooring mast, for docking dirigibles, would add stress to the building's frame and ""could not simply be dropped atop the Empire State Building."" The building needed to be ""modified and strengthened"" to accommodate this situation, requiring additional engineering and resources. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen, which is extremely flammable. Owners of the building realized if an accident like the Hindenburg were to take place above a densely populated city or area such as downtown New York, results would have been far worse, raising concerns about safety and liability. Builders' greatest obstacle would be nature itself. Winds atop the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the air ship could tether to the mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast, making passenger transfer dangerous and impractical. In addition, due to an existing law against airships flying too low, dirigibles could not legally moor at the Empire State Building. Given these combined challenges, ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose."""
1437	16270	6	3	"In the excerpt, ""the mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced some obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that in order to build it for docking dirigibles, they had to spend over sixty thousand dollars; this significant sum meant modifications had to be made to the building's framework to support the immense weight and stress of the airships. Also, another obstacle was the issue of safety. Dirigibles were not that safe; being filled with flammable gas, the risk of a catastrophic fire was considerable, especially given that the docking would occur over an area with many other buildings and people around. Those are a few obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow the docking of dirigibles, highlighting the practical and safety-related concerns that ultimately led to the abandonment of the ambitious plan."
1438	16271	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by author @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced some obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A first obstacle the builders faced was the concern of the building collapsing over time with ""all the weight of the dirigibles. They would have to spend more money and time to create a frame for the Empire State Building to support the dirigibles."" @CAPS1 @NUM1 supports that obstacle ""a thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building would add stress to the building's frame"". The builders had to contemplate the engineering challenges and financial implications. A second obstacle builders of the Empire State Building came upon on attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the building was the concerns of the thousands of citizens just below the tall building. After a German dirigible was on fire in Jersey, they realized how serious the situation could become. ""Owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" The potential for catastrophic accidents involving dirigibles so close to the city was a major safety issue. These were two of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced, demonstrating the complexities of balancing innovation with safety and structural integrity."
1439	16272	6	3	In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of these obstacles being stress. Yes, stress. This is because when you have a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the Empire State building, only by which is held by a single cable tether, it adds stress to the frame of the building, especially considering the immense weight and potential pull of the airship. Another obstacle the builders faced was safety. Seeing as most dirigibles have been known to use hydrogen rather than helium, you would think hydrogen is the one to go with. Unfortunately, hydrogen is a fire caution because it is extremely flamable, making even the slightest spark a potential disaster. So safety was definitely another obstacle in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the empire state building. A final obstacle the builders faced was nature itself. This is simply because the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast, on repeat because violent currents would constantly shifting the winds on the top of the building, making docking and passenger transfer extremely difficult. There would be no solution, even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, as the unpredictable winds would render the entire operation impractical. These are the obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, in the informative excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, highlighting the significant challenges that ultimately led to the abandonment of this ambitious plan.
1440	16273	6	3	When the Empire State Building was faced with a dirigible docking station they encountered many problems. The first problem they encountered was the wind. The wind over a thousand feet in the air is never going to be calm. Once they got the dirigible close to the tower there would be no way they could keep it still enough to refuel and let passengers on or off the dirigible. The second problem they ran into was helium is flammable. If somehow that helium caught fire it would be catastrophic in such a place as downtown New York. The third and final reason is it is illegal to have an aircraft that low in a city. There was no way this was going to work out so they stopped moving forward on this plan.
1441	16274	6	3	"The @ORGANIZATION1 spire was originally built to be more than just visibly stimulating. The spire was actually a mooring mast to be used for docking dirigibles. Dirigibles, or blimps, were thought to be the transportation of the future, but the mast had many obstacles it had to overcome. Al Smith saw an opportunity to make the Empire State Building and all of New York on the fore front of modern travel. The mast would have to support and withstand a dirigibles weight so, ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" The constant threat of wind made the plans too dangerous as well. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Finally, most dirigibles were highly flammable and couldn't be safely docked with at endangering the public. A disaster like that would have been much worse..."" if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. Ultimately, the challenges proved insurmountable, and the original vision of the Empire State Building as a dirigible docking station was abandoned, but the idea was a forward thinking, if ultimately impractical, attempt to embrace the future of travel."
1442	16275	6	3	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. These issues included safety, nature and an existing law. Safety was the greatest obstacle. These dirigibles ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" @CAPS1 the buildings in downtown New York stand so close together, one building such as the Empire State Building catching on fire could have devastating effects. A single spark could have ignited the hydrogen, leading to a catastrophic event. The hardest problem to overcome would have been nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" It would have been impossible to keep the back of a dirigible from swiveling around, making docking extremely hazardous for both the airship and the building. Also, the dirigibles would be hanging high above cars and people on the streets below, posing a significant risk of falling debris or even a crash. The last reason the dirigibles should not be moored at the Empire State building was because of a law that prohibited ""airships flying flying too low over urban areas."" This made the entire plan illegal, and although it was a good plan, it was not well thought out and ultimately unfeasible due to these considerable challenges."
1443	16276	6	3	The builders faced many problems trying to allow the dirigibles to dock. The biggest obstacle they had was the wind. At that elevation the wind was constantly shifting. If the dirigibles were tethered, the back would swivel unpredictably, making docking maneuvers difficult. Another problem was that they could not weigh it down. Sence it was elevated, if the dirigible was weighted down it would fall, straining the tethering system and potentially causing damage. Those are some of the obstacles the builders faced as they worked to create a functional and safe docking solution.
1444	16277	6	3	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast. One obstacle they faced was the lack of a suitable landing area, especially given the building's height. They would have to design a mast specifically for the dirigibles. Another obstacle was that each of the dirigibles would be held by a single cable tether and that would add significant stress to the building's frame. Next, New York City would have to spend over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications that had to be made to the building's framework to support the mast and the associated stresses. Then the greatest reason of safety came upon them. That was, most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium for lift. And hydrogen is highly flammable. On May 6, 1937 a German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The owners of the Empire state building realized if that happened in New York how big of a problem that would cause. The final and greatest obstacle they faced to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. From all the violent wind and air currents would be hard to tether the dirigibles safely to the mast. In conclusion, those were the obstacles the builders of the Empire state Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to land there, ultimately making the entire endeavor impractical and unsafe."
1445	16278	6	3	"There were several major obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One such problem was that, ""the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have been transmitted all the way to the building's foundation..."". It cost over $2 million to make the modifications nesescary to do this. Also, the, ""roof had to be completed before the framing of the mooring mast could take place."" Ultimately, they did not solve several other obstacles. Forein dirigibles normally ""used hydrogen rather than helium..."" And this would cause vast damage if they crashed in ""a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" In addition, being so high, the dirigible could not be weighted down in the back and thus would swivll around the mast. There was also a law prohibiting ""airships flying too low over urban areas."" In the end there were too many obstacles so the dirigible docking plan was scrapped."
1446	16279	6	3	There were many obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles that had to be faced was dealing with the highly flammable hydrogen from dirigibles, especially those originating outside of the United States. The fear was that a fire involving such a large volume of hydrogen would be catastrophic in a densely populated area. Another obstacle was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast, posing a significant control challenge. The unpredictable winds made it hard to control the dirigible, leading to concerns about the dirigible crashing into the building. Those were some of the considerable obstacles that were faced during the planning and potential execution of this ambitious project.
1447	16280	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Since the German dirigible the Hindenburg was destroyed in New Jersey, it would have been even more dangerous over a densely populated area like New York, where the Empire State Building was located. Ultimately, the greatest obstacle to the success of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to unpredictable air currents. Dirigibles would not be safe dangling high above pedestrians on the street because of these air currents. The major problem architects faced was that dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building due to the unsafe air currents and winds. Even though it seemed like a good idea at the time, it was not practical or safe, and it was abandoned because of these insurmountable challenges.
1448	16281	6	3	"Obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, were not easy to overcome. Most dirigibles were massive, and dealing with them was no easy task. ""Some as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York."" In this quote it tells of their massive size and proves how difficult it would be to control and land them safely. Another obstacle the workers had to face is modifying the already set structure of the Empire State Building, also money spent as indicated by this quote. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" This quote proves that the addition of the mooring mast would be not only tiring for the workers, but also a lot of money would be spent on a failed project. They got their tall building, but ultimately were unable to achieve the mooring mast, showcasing the impracticality of the initial vision."
1449	16282	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. Because the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, attempting to dock an airship proved incredibly dangerous. Also, because the Empire State Building has an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, practical implementation became legally fraught. Ultimately, these factors rendered the mooring mast's intended purpose unrealizable.
1450	16283	6	3	The builders were building about @NUM1 ft high above surface, so safety is an issue, especially for the construction workers. Then a @NUM2 ft @CAPS2 would moor at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, which would add stress to the building (@CAPS2 load would). Also, the wind pressure would have to be transmitted @NUM3 ft below to the foundation, requiring robust engineering. So it's a @CAPS1 that could affect @CAPS3 in unpredictable ways. The @CAPS2 could catch on fire on top of Downtown New York, potentially hurting @CAPS3 and damaging property. And it's costing a lot of money, approximately @NUM4 dollars, making it a risky and expensive endeavor overall. Therefore, careful consideration and thorough risk assessment are essential for this project's viability.
1451	16284	6	3	Allowing the dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building took some obstacles. First, there was a lack of suitable landing area in New York City. To solve this, Al Smith added a mooring mast to the top of the Empire State Building. This would allow the dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling, service, and to let passengers off and on. Another obstacle for allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was the stress being added to the building's frame because of a one thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of a building held by a single cable tether. To accommodate the situation, the steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be strengthened and modified. Over Sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework. The final and greatest obstacle for successful use of the mooring mast was nature. The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Lead weights would be used to weight down dirigibles landed in open fields. But losing the lead weights at the Empire State building where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street was not very safe at all. These persistent wind issues ultimately proved insurmountable, contributing to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan, highlighting nature's power over even the most ambitious human endeavors.
1452	16285	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock thousands of feet above the New York streets. One of their many problems was the sheer size of the dirigibles, somewhere as long as one-thousand feet. Another problem they faced was keeping the back of the ship from swiveling around the mooring mast. Usually, the backs of these blimp-like structure's were anchored down by lead weights, but to have lead weights dangling high above the streets was way too risky not to mention unpractical, given the heavy winds that high up. Ultimately, the impracticality of safely securing such large airships to the building led to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan.
1453	16286	6	3	There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the fact that they needed a mooring mast so that the dirigibles could anchor, but they couldn't drop a mooring mast on the flat surface of the Empire State Building's roof, as it would put too much stress on the building's structure. This problem of finding a suitable anchoring solution cost over sixty thousand dollars. Another obstacle was safety precautions. The dirigibles were mostly filled with highly flammable hydrogen. If a dirigible was to catch on fire, then the whole Empire State Building would be destroyed, including everyone in it. It also wasn't safe because strong, violent winds could blow and detach the dirigible, causing danger to pedestrians below. One other obstacle that the builders faced was the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. If they tried to anchor a dirigible on the Empire State Building, it would be an illegal act. Due to all of these obstacles not getting results, the whole idea was eventually abandoned and has disappeared from practical consideration.
1454	16287	6	3	"The architects, engineers, and workers or the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to attach a dirigible dock to the top of the building. The first troubling encounter for the builders was they ""could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state building."" The engineers and architects needed to make @NUM1 dollars worth of repairs to strengthen the building's framework. Mother nature herself was also a problem. The constantly shifting winds would make it hard to stay landed unless they were weighed down with heavy cables. Even weighing down the zeppelins proposed a threat of a weight falling and killing an innocent person on the streets below. Lastly a law prevented dirigibles from flying too low over a city. If a spike from another building hit and popped the balloon, there would be an absolute disaster. Overall there were many obstacles preventing the idea of a dirigible dock to ever become true, solidifying its fate as an impractical and ultimately unrealized concept."
1455	16288	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted the builders faced quite a few problems. They faced problems on constructing the building, unsure if they could complete it. They also faced a bad climate, and the challenge of determining how much the dirigibles weighted and whether the mast could hold them. On paragraph fourteen it says ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights."" These details demonstrate the complex challenges the workers had to face during the construction."
1456	16289	6	3	The obstacals he had was that the problems where never really solved, often only temporarily addressed, and that had caused problems with the wind, specifically creating unpredictable drafts and impacting the structure's stability.
1457	16290	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous problems dealing with the mooring mast. First of all, I would say safety was the number one issue. If the dirigible were to catch on fire, it could land on the main streets of New York City, posing a hazard to hundreds of pedestrians. Also, the weather was another factor. If it were too windy to fly all the time, then the mast would be a waste. When I read that they had to spend <@NUM1</@CAPS1> to modify the building's framework, I started thinking of all the other things a town could do with @MONEY1. There was also an existing law that made it illegal for any airships to be even remotely close to the Empire State Building. All things considered, the idea of the mooring mast was just a very poorly planned idea.
1458	16291	6	3	The architects of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was the architects had to fix the frame of the building in order to transmit the stress of the dirigible to the bottom of the building. Another obstacle the architects faced was the architects had to complete the roof before the framing of the mooring mast could take place. The architects of the Empire State Building also had to make sure that the mast's skeleton was made out of steel so that the mast looked like the rest of the Empire State Building and not stick out, showcasing the challenges involved in integrating such an ambitious feature into the iconic skyscraper.
1459	16292	6	3	There were many problems and obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, such as nature itself. At @NUM1 ft. the winds were just too strong and unpredictable to get close to and dock a dirigible. On top of nature, laws prevented the landing. Airships could not fly low over urban areas so even attempting to approach the area would be illegal. This idea still posed a great deal of potential danger even if there were no laws against it and wind didn't exist. Many dirigibles were made using hydrogen, which is highly flammable, adding to the peril. In such a highly populated area as New York City if one were to catch fire the damage would be horrifying. I hope Al Smith was willing to pay thousands of dollars for the title of world's tallest building because he didn't get his mast. The docking station was ultimately deemed too impractical and dangerous for regular use.
1460	16293	6	3	"Constructing a building was hard, but attempting to build the world's tallest building was intense. The mast atop the Empire State Building caused many obstacles for the builders such as having to strengthen the framework of the whole building. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the Empire State building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's framework."" The architects also wanted to make the mooring mast ornamental, or decorative. ""Rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects design is shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside-."" The building had to have two extra floors added, one ""open observation platform"" and a ""boarding area for dirigible passengers."" Ultimately, these additions aimed to accommodate the anticipated airship traffic. Even though the mast was doomed to never fulfill its purpose, the building was still hailed the world's tallest building, a testament to ambition overcoming impracticality."
1461	16294	6	3	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast,"" by @ORGANIZATION2, certain obstacles such as foundation support, nature, and safety challenged the building of the docking station for dirigibles. The first problem the architects faced was the docked dirigibles placing too much stress on the building. To combat this problem, drastic changes to the building would have to be made. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1, @CAPS2 @NUM2) This change was stated to cost over sixty thousand dollars, a significant sum at the time, demonstrating the scale of the structural reinforcement required. Another obstacle the builders faced upon constructing the mooring mast, was nature. At this height, the wind currents are violent and unpredictable. Despite being tethered to the building, the dirigibles would spin and twist around the mass, an unsecure and dangerous aspect. Lastly, as the except claims the greatest reason for not being successful, the safety violations of the mast were too great. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen... and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire... the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident would have been...above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" (@CAPS1 @NUM3, @CAPS2 @NUM4) The moor provided severe risk to the safety of the people of New York. This problem served as a serious problem, thus serving as an obstacle for the builders of the mooring mass. The building's foundations, nature, and safety violations all served as problems for the builders creating the mooring mass, ultimately preventing the successful implementation of the dirigible docking station."
1462	16295	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the building. Dirigibles are enormous steel framed balloons filled with hydrogen and helium maneuvered by the use of propellers and rudders. Al Smith wanted to add a mooring mast to the top of the building that would let dirigibles anchor for several hours for refueling or service. However, the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be sent all the way to the building's foundation. This cost over @MONEY1 worth of modifications to be made to the framework. On May 6, 1937, when the Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the builders realized how catastrophic it would have been had a similar incident taken place above the densely populated area of downtown New York. The winds at the top of the building would constantly shift due to harsh and violent air currents, and the back of the ship would constantly swing around. Also, the existing law against airships flying too low over cities and urban areas would mean dirigibles would not be allowed to moor at the Empire State Building. Ultimately, the combination of structural challenges, safety concerns highlighted by the Hindenburg disaster, and legal restrictions rendered the dirigible docking plan unfeasible. All in all, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the building.
1463	16296	6	3	"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted some obstacles the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are the winds were too strong and most used hydrogen instead of helium which is very flammable. The way that the dirigibles would dock to the building was by a cord attached to the mast. The dirigibles would then be ""dangling high above pedestrians in the street"" (@NUM1). This was ""neither practical nor safe"" (@NUM1) This would not only endanger the pedestrians below but also the people on the dirigibles. The wind was so strong that it could throw it into a building. Most dirigibles fuel on hydrogen rather than helium; hydrogen is much more flammable. ""The German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey"" (@NUM3). The owners of the Empire State building saw this as another huge problem because of how much worse it would be if one caught fire in densely populated New York. The height of the building also made docking difficult, as it was hard to maneuver the large airships in the narrow streets. Ultimately, the combination of strong winds, flammable hydrogen, and the inherent dangers of docking such massive crafts to a skyscraper made the mooring mast concept unworkable, leading to its abandonment."
1464	16297	6	3	"The Empire State Building during it's construction was being planned to serve as a mast, in which dirigibles could be attached to. The builders of the building did not realize the severity of the obstacles preventing them from safely accomplishing this feat. Most of the problems presented for the most part were concerning safety. Due to safety issues the mast was considered too lucrative an idea, and posed too much of a danger. There were simply too many possible opportunities for something to go wrong. One of these issues was that dirigibles contain dangerous flammable gases, that if something went wrong a flaming dirigible coming down on downtown New York City would cause major damage. Another obstacle preventing this idea from becoming reality was that the dirigible tethered to the mast would be ""constantly shifting due to the violent air currents"" (para @NUM1), making passenger transfer exceptionally risky. Another reason why it couldn't be done ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (para @NUM2), further complicating the logistics and legality of the operation. All of the problems that could not be solved plausibly were the reason why the mast was unrealistic. Ultimately, the combination of safety concerns, logistical nightmares, and legal restrictions made the dirigible mast concept untenable."
1465	16298	6	3	"In The mooring mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted the reason for the tall spire was revealed as a mooring mast for zeppelins to land. there were many difficultys faced by the builders of the Empire state building in attempt for zeppelins to actually land there. one difficulty was the stress added by the weight of the dirigible ""over @NUM1 $ of work was done to the foundation."" This was difficult because adding that much steel to a beautiful building couldn't be easy, especially considering the architectural considerations. Another difficulty involved ""the mast... would to a conical head this would house a mooring arm."" Think about how easy it is to take a ornate @NUM2 foot spire @NUM3 feet to the top, not easy, and requiring precise engineering and logistical planning. Last ""the winds at top were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" which meant all the framing workers went through hell to make the building, enduring dangerous conditions to realize this ambitious vision. Ultimately, these challenges highlight the immense effort and risk involved in attempting to make the Empire State Building a functional zeppelin mooring mast."
1466	16299	6	3	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was how much stress would be put on the building's frame. L¸sted says, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building's frame. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven feet below."" The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation, adding significant cost and complexity to the already ambitious project. If the Empire State building was going to make this happen they would have to change the frame of it. This was a top obstacle to overcome. Also an obstacle they would have to face was peoples safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If they were to make this happen there would always be the risk of someone catching on fire. This posed an unacceptable risk to passengers, crew, and the building itself. Making the Empire State building a dock would have many obstacles to overcome if they wanted to make this happen, ultimately proving the impracticality of the endeavor."
1467	16300	6	3	Many obstacles faced the builders of the Empire State Building. The biggest problem is the fact that it was illegal for a dirigible to fly that low in urban areas, stated in paragraph @NUM1. Another problem was that most of the @ORGANIZATION2's dirigibles used hydrogen, which is very flammable. So if what happened to the Hindenburg happened at the Empire State Building then the accident would have been much worse, especially with people walking the streets below, stated in paragraph @NUM2. Another problem was nature. The winds were ferocious at the top of the building and were always shifting. So if a dirigible was docked to the mast, the lead weights that keep the dirigible from floating away, like anchors, would be dangling over pedestrians ready to fall in an instant, stated in paragraph @NUM3. Also, fears of the sharp edges and forceful winds would cause the dirigible to get punctured and pop. These factors ultimately made the dirigible docking idea impractical and unsafe.
1468	16301	6	3	"During the @DATE1's Dirigibles were being hailed as the transportation of the future. Dirigibles had a top speed of eighty miles per hour, and cruise at about seventy miles per hour for thousands of miles. The main obstacle that the Dirigibles would face in landing in New York City was the lack of suitable landing area. Another obstacle the architects and empire state builders faced was designing a mast that could allow the Dirigible to dock to the building, and also allowing people in and out of vehicle. Architects knew that they couldn't simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof. ""An A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame,"" so architects had to reconstruct the building's foundation to strengthen the structure of the building. The greatest obstacle that the Empire State builders faced was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The violent air currents at the top of the empire state building would make it dangerous and unsafe for Dirigibles to dock with the building; ultimately, the unpredictable weather conditions proved to be an insurmountable hurdle for the ambitious dirigible docking plan."
1469	16302	6	3	"In this excerpt Al Smith had many obstacles to overcome when he wanted Dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. The smallest obstacle was building this top so Dirigibles could moor at the building. ""The top would have cost over $2 million for the needed modifications on the framework"". Another obstacle faced was the fact that there was an existing law in place against this. ""The other practical reason Dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against low flying air ships."" The issue of safety was a tricky obstacle. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is very flammable"". The greatest obstacle was nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" In this excerpt the obstacles for Al Smith and his team were too great, and they could not overcome them, ultimately making the Dirigible docking project unfeasible."
1470	16303	6	3	"On December 11, 1929, Al Smith, the four-term governor of New York, announced that the Empire State Building would reach the height of 1,250 feet. At the time it would be the world's tallest building, but the builders faced obstacles with the more distinctive part; allowing dirigibles to dock there. First, it would be difficult to build a suitable landing area. As described in paragraph @NUM1 of the excerpt, a dirigible held by a single cable would add stress to the building's frame. Therefore, the steel frame would have to be modified and strengthened so that the added stress would be transmitted all the way down to the building's foundation, adding considerable cost and complexity to the construction. Also, safety is a huge issue. In paragraph @NUM2, it stated that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The builders came to realize that if one of the dirigibles were to catch fire, like the German Hindenburg in New Jersey, it would cause huge problems due to the fact that New York is densely populated, and the resulting disaster would be catastrophic. Lastly, nature itself is an obstacle for the builders. The winds on top of the building are constantly shifting due to violent air currents. As described in paragraph @NUM3, the back of the ship would swivel around and the lead weights would be dangerous for the pedestrians down below, posing a significant risk to public safety. Overall, the construction of the mast was difficult, and unfortunately is never to be used."
1471	16304	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem, according to the excerpt, is that ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the frame."" They would need to spend over $2 million in order to modify the building's framework. Another issue, of course, was the safety of the mast. Most of the zeppelins from places besides the U.S., did not use helium. Instead, those limbs used hydrogen which is highly flammable and would have caused disaster if ignited above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. The excerpt also states that, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Finally, there was already a law in place preventing airships from flying too low over urban areas, Therefore, it would be illegal for a blimp to attach to or even go near the Empire State Building. For the reasons stated, builders were not able to build a mooring mast a top the Empire State Building, effectively ending the dream of transatlantic airship travel directly to midtown Manhattan."
1472	16305	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems in trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the top. @CAPS1 ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof"" because the design needed to account for significant wind forces. @CAPS2 the designers had to find a way for the dirigible to dock securely at the top of the building. Even if they did find a way for it to dock though, ""a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame,"" potentially compromising its structural integrity. This set the builders back again because even if they did find a way to dock the dirigible the Empire State Building would need ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications"" to reinforce the structure. Even though that's possible there ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" creating further legal and logistical hurdles. The builders faced many obstacles that set them back, but they made a valiant attempt to see their dream come true, despite the numerous challenges ultimately making the dirigible docking plan unfeasible."
1473	16306	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One example is that by adding the dirigible, it would add stress to the building. The frame of the Empire State Building would have to be changed due to the pressure that would be put on the building. All of the changes that would have to be made would add up to over sixty thousand dollars, a considerable sum at the time. Now, there would also be 102 floors, a remarkable feat of engineering. The top floor would be the boarding area as well as an observation area, offering stunning views. One more thing they had done for the mooring masts was raise an American flag on top, a symbol of pride. All of these accommodations were made for the help of dirigibles docking on top of the Empire State building, though ultimately, the plan proved impractical.
1474	16307	6	3	"The designers of the Empire State Building faced many challenges in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on its peak. ""The greatest reason was safety"" (para @NUM1). The dirigibles were dangerous. Strong winds could blow them in different directions, possibly hitting the building. And if there was a crash, the debris would rain upon New York City. Since there was wind, they would have to use lead weights to hold a dirigible in place, a method typically used in mooring fields. However above the city this would be ""neither practical nor safe"" (para @NUM2). Finally, there was a law prohibiting airships from flying low over urban areas. This would cause the docking to be illegal, further complicating the already difficult endeavor. For these reasons, the builders of the Empire State Building faced significant challenges allowing blimps, or dirigibles, to dock on the building."
1475	16308	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. An example would be from the excerpt when the author writes in paragraph 6 ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of suitable landing area."" This quote means the builders were faced with the challenge of space to land the dirigibles because New York City was a relatively crowded area. This required innovative solutions to accommodate the large airships in a dense urban environment. Another example would be in paragraph @NUM1, when the author tells about the safety hazards. Many dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, which is extremely flammable, creating a significant risk in the heart of the city. A last example would be in paragraph @NUM2 when the author describes the safety hazards. The builders had to consider the violent winds on the top of the building, making docking a dangerous maneuver. Many obstacles came upon the builders, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan."
1476	16309	6	3	There were many obstacles for the builders of the mast attempting to allow dirigibles to dock, such as laws, nature, and overlooked detail. Laws were an obstacle because of safety risks of having a dirigible over a densely populated area, such as the Hindenburg accident demonstrated the potential for catastrophic fires. Nature was a problem because of the violent winds at the top of the mast, which would make the ship unsteady and docking a perilous maneuver. The last obstacle was that the builders of the mast overlooked all the other obstacles, and safety risks, ultimately leading to the project's impracticality and eventual abandonment.
1477	16310	6	3	...the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed; the greatest reason was one of safety. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen. Hydrogen, rather than helium, was cheaper but highly flammable. The Hindenburg disaster near Lakehurst, New Jersey, only five years after the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York, thus highlighting the impracticality and danger of the mast's intended use.
1478	16311	6	3	"There are many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle the builders had to face was they had ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to be made to the building's framework,"" a considerable sum at the time that added significantly to the project's budget. Another obstacle the builders faced was meeting the president of an airship transport company and the plan to offer dirigible service across the Pacific Ocean, requiring complex logistical coordination and raising questions about the feasibility of such a route. That is just two of the many obstacles the builders faced while building the Empire State Building, highlighting the ambitious and ultimately impractical nature of incorporating dirigible docking into the building's design."
1479	16312	6	3	Some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are significant structural concerns. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation, as the mooring forces were substantial. Indeed, over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework to even attempt to support the airships. Another obstacle that they faced is that dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building because there was an existing law against airships flying too low over suburban areas, further complicating the logistics. The greatest obstacle, however, is that the violent air currents at that height would make the back of the ship swivel around the mooring mast, rendering the entire docking procedure extremely dangerous and impractical. These combined factors ultimately led to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan, highlighting the numerous challenges involved.
1480	16313	6	3	I think the builders main problem they faced was making sure people would be able to safely get off the dirigibles and onto the actual building. This involved designing a secure and stable mooring mast atop the Empire State Building, along with a safe transfer platform. They would also need to make sure that the blimp wouldn't burst into flames if it came close or crashed into the Empire State Building, necessitating careful consideration of materials and procedures to mitigate fire hazards, ultimately ensuring passenger safety.
1481	16314	6	3	"Based on ""The Mooring Mast"" there were several obstacles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First of all, they couldn't just put a mast a top the building because it would put too much pressure on the building's frame. Also the stress would be transmitted all the way to the foundation of the building, which was 11 hundred feet below the mast. So before they could build anything, they had to re-inforce the entire structure of the Empire State Building. Finally these obstacles were fixed, and the mooring mast was successfully constructed to accommodate dirigibles, showing that they were able to overcome considerable structural challenges."
1482	16315	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are: they choose dirigible instead of balloon, because the fabric used in dirigibles is lighter. Second, their extended use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area and the safety of passengers getting on or off presented significant challenges. These considerations ultimately contributed to the impracticality of the dirigible docking station concept.
1483	16316	6	3	The first obstacle that the builders of the Empire State faced was the lack of a suitable landing area for airships. The second obstacle that the builders of the Empire State faced was that the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building's flat roof, as structural integrity had to be considered. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself, as the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, ultimately rendering the mooring mast concept impractical.
1484	16317	6	3	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow the dirigibles to dock were very difficult. One difficulty that they had was the mooring mast and nature itself. When the dirigibles would come to the building, the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, and the only way that they could moor is if they weighted down the back; using them at the Empire State Building won't be practical or safe, with pedestrians below. Another obstacle that the builders had was an existing law. The law was against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building, or even approach the area. This was an obstacle because they didn't have much to do about this since it's a government thing holding them back. These are just some obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow the dirigibles to dock, ultimately rendering the ambitious plan unfeasible.
1485	16318	6	3	In the 1920s, dirigibles were considered to be the future of transportation. Although useful, dirigibles had an issue: there was not enough landing area in New York City. With this in mind, Al Smith saw an opportunity for his Empire State Building; he would construct a mooring mast on the top of the building. This would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours, refuel, and also allow passengers to disembark and embark. Adding a mooring mast seemed foolproof at the time, but this new construction plan endured many obstacles. The first obstacle was how to add a mooring mast without adding undue stress to the building's frame. Architects determined that the stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. This led to the second obstacle, which was modifying and strengthening the steel frame of the Empire State Building to accommodate the first obstacle and ensure the building's structural integrity. Finally, the third obstacle was the expense. Modifying the building's new framework would cost over sixty thousand dollars, a considerable sum at the time. Consequently, while Al Smith saw a great opportunity for the Empire State Building, he was faced with significant engineering and financial obstacles in realizing his vision.
1486	16319	6	3	"In the excerpt @ORGANIZATION2, written by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the Empire State Building face obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, ""one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of suitable landing areas."" (paragraph 6). If the dirigibles can't land, it could cause destruction and could be very dangerous to people. In paragraph @NUM1, Al Smith says, ""It's on level all right no kidding wer'e working on the thing right now."" This shows the readers that the way he words things sounds almost unreliable. When constructing the idea of dirigibles, a mooring mast had to be added to the top of the building to allow passengers on and off. However, this idea was unsafe. ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using Empire State building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on street was neither practical nor safe."" (paragraph @NUM2). This idea was unsafe, so why would they build something potentially harmful to others? In the excerpt The Mooring Mast written by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders have a hard time constructing the dirigibles, ultimately leading to a flawed and ultimately unrealized plan that prioritized ambition over safety."
1487	16320	6	3	"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The most influential obstacle was nature. According to the passage, ""the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting."" This would make it hard for dirigibles to dock in the first place. If they even succeeded in docking then the back of the dirigibles would shift and float around. The only way to solve that would be to add weights to the back of the dirigibles. Then weights would be floating high above the heads of pedestrians, which ""was neither practical or safe,"" rendering the docking process dangerous. Another huge obstacle in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock was the law. At that time there was a law against any kind of aircraft to ""fly too low over urban areas."" As the passage clarifies ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to even tie up to the building or even approach the area."" Given these significant challenges related to safety and legality, the mooring mast idea was dropped, thus ending the ambitious plan."
1488	16321	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in the attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there, ""The architect could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof"". A thousand-foot dirigible tethered by a single cable would add too much stress to the building's frame. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. If not the Empire State Building might fall over. For the Empire State Building to take the extra load the architect would have to modify and strengthen the building's existing framework. Also the ornate mast would be difficult to raise on top of the Empire State build due to the high winds. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". If the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the dirigible would swivel around and around the mooring mast. If this happened the dirigible would crash into the Empire State Building or other building. This would be bad for the people on the street, creating a dangerous situation. Where dirigibles usually land are in open fields, offering much more space and safety. The dirigible could be weighted down in the back with a lead weight. But on top of the Empire State Building dangling weights above pedestrians was neither practical nor safe, posing a significant risk. Also laws were passed restricting a dirigible from getting too close to a building, further hindering the docking plan. Thus, the proposed dirigible mooring was fraught with too many engineering and safety challenges to overcome."
1489	16322	6	3	In the excerpt Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that many modifications had to be made to the building's framework. The dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted to the building's foundation. Another reason builders faced many obstacles is that most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, which would be very dangerous if a fire occurred, especially in a highly populated area. Another reason is due to violent air currents, the back of a dirigible would swivel around the mooring mast. As it says on page @NUM1, paragraph @NUM2, the dirigible would dangle above pedestrians on the street, which isn't practical or safe. Lastly, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, and it was illegal for dirigibles to tie up to the building or even approach the building. In conclusion, builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, ultimately making the endeavor impractical and unsafe.
1490	16323	6	3	"The builders faced many problems when attempting to build a dirigible dock on the Empire State Building which ranged from legal, to structural, to logistical problems. Firstly there was a law in place which restricted airships from ""flying too low over urban area's"" as explained in paragraph 1. In addition to this legal problem, the builders faced the structural problem of putting a mooring mast on top of a skyscraper. According to the article the stress of the dirigible load along with wind pressure would have to be transmitted over eleven hundred feet to the foundation. Because of this added weigh over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications were made to the building as cited in paragraph 2. Also the logistics of docking a dirigible at such an altitude were quite challenging, which involved specialized equipment and trained personnel. In fact half of the attempted dirigible landings at the Empire State Building were aborted due to high winds, showcasing the impracticality of the project. Although a dirigible landing mast would have put the Empire State Building on the forefront of modern travel, it could not be done due to legal, structural and logistical problems."
1491	16324	6	3	"The builders faced multiple obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building. If the thousand-foot dirigible tried to land on top of the Empire State Building, it ""would add stress to the building's frame"" (paragraph @NUM1), potentially compromising its structural integrity. The building would then have to be modified to meet these needs, adding significant cost and complexity to the project. Nature played as a big obstacle, as well. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (paragraph @NUM2), making precise maneuvering exceptionally difficult. If the dirigible tried to land, the back of it would swivel around and around the landing zone, creating an unsafe environment for both the airship and the building. Finally, the government also prevented dirigibles from docking on the building. There was, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM3), posing legal challenges to the ambitious plan. These three main reasons prevented dirigibles from landing on top of The Empire State Building, effectively grounding the initial vision."
1492	16325	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced @NUM1 major obstacles. One major problem was that they considered using hydrogen for mooring airships to the building's mast, but hydrogen is highly flammable, and they were in a highly populated area. Another problem had to do with laws, because aircrafts aren't allowed to fly too low over urban areas. Also, the strong winds at that height made it impossible to safely land and secure airships. Many problems were faced in the building of the Empire State Building.
1493	16326	6	3	They got a good idea to make that building, but the problems were always big, like securing funding and navigating regulations. Making a plan, including architectural blueprints and construction schedules, and creating the design itself, with considerations for aesthetics and functionality, was so difficult to make that building a reality.
1494	16327	6	3	Many obstacles were established for the workers, in allowing dirigibles dock on the Empire State Building. At first they thought they knew what they were doing, they were wrong. The workers first obstacle was to make docking at the Empire State building safe. However it was hard to make that happen because it was above civilians and if it ever dropped the result would be extremely serious, including potential loss of life and significant property damage. The second obstacle that got in their way was the wind pressure. It would of caused an unreliable support of the mast which would screw up the docking of the dirigible, making the entire process dangerous and unpredictable. Finally the dirigible is the last piece to the puzzle with disaster. In the section The Fate of The Mast it gives that the dirigible is run on hydrogen which is extremely flammable. Just that sentence alone establishes that it is not safe for the environment, especially considering the building's location in a densely populated urban area. By far many obstacles got in the way of the process of the mast. But docking was a whole different idea. Many obstacles had gotten in the way of the builders in attempting dirigibles to dock there, ultimately making it an unfeasible plan.
1495	16328	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. They had to face being up in the air for so long. They also had to face trying to dock the dirigible on top of the roof while still staying safe themselves. This meant devising innovative solutions to ensure both the airship's securement and the safety of ground personnel during the docking procedure.
1496	16329	6	3	The Empire State Building did have a flat roof, but they could not just drop the mooring mast on top because it would add stress to the frame. To build a mooring mast, the cost would be more than sixty thousand dollars. Building a mooring mast would not be easy because the wind on top of the Empire State Building would constantly change direction; therefore, the dirigibles would be swirling around. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these on the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe. Furthermore, there was a law that aircraft should not fly too low over urban areas. The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, adding another layer of complexity to the already challenging mooring attempts. Therefore, for dirigibles to land on top of the Empire State Building, there were many obstacles, making the prospect ultimately unfeasible and impractical.
1497	16330	6	3	"In the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, obstacles builders faced building a mast for dirigibles to dock there are detailed. One obstacle builders faced was how to go about attaching it. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether would add stress to the building's frame."" The potential for wind shear and the immense weight of a moored airship posed significant engineering challenges. Another obstacle would be the accumulated cost of the revisions due to the first problem. ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's frame work."" This significant expenditure further complicated the project's viability. These obstacles prevented the mast for ever being used its intended purpose, ultimately rendering the ambitious plan impractical."
1498	16331	6	3	The construction of the mast was intentionally a good idea, but the people who were constructing it never actually realized the true dangers of the whole idea. Although they should have known, they should have realized that because the ship was attached to the mast in one area, the ship was bound to swing around when it comes to a windy day because of the lack of weight. The builders also had to keep in mind that because the idea was huge, they had to make it perfect. They had to realize that many other builders are going to try this concept, which means they have to lead by example. If not, then the other builders would have major problems, and people would be in danger, particularly those nearby. The builders and men also thought about using weights to balance off the weight of the ship, a concept they should have explored further. They needed to find a safe way to accomplish this, and unfortunately, they could not. If they went through with it without properly testing, one accident could have killed many people. The Dirigible was a great idea, but they should have thought out all the ideas and potential problems before they went ahead and built it; a more thorough risk assessment was needed to avoid potential disaster.
1499	16332	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Shortridge, Al Smith faced numerous problems. One problem they had was the ""dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"" (p. 71). Al Smith had to modify and strengthen the building to accommodate the new situation. The dirigible was so big that they could not even anchor the back of it to the roof. Al Smith had a difficult time trying to figure out how the dirigibles would land because the wind was extremely difficult; the pilot could not even control the dirigible. Al Smith had to put another sixty thousand dollars into it because of the modifications. Al Smith was the one who thought of this idea; then he realized it wouldn't work. Still, Al Smith did finish constructing it, but the dirigibles could not dock there, rendering the project ultimately unsuccessful despite the effort and investment."
1500	16333	6	3	"Many obstacles faced the builders of the Empire State Building in their attempts to dock dirigibles or zeppelins. First and foremost, a mooring mast would have to be added to the building. However, according to the Empire State Building Company, ""over sixty thousand dollar's worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"" before a dirigible could be moored to the mast. Secondly, outside of the United States, most dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen gas, rather than helium, as shown in Empire State Building Company 1. The owners realized that it would be quite dangerous to have a dirigible moored over downtown New York, after the German ""Hindenburg"" ""was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey."" (Empire State Building Company 1). In accordance with the Empire State Building Company 3, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Violent winds, caused by air currents at the top of the building would cause a moored dirigible to swivel, and using lead weights to counter this would be dangerous over such a densely populated area. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles could not even dock in December 1930 due to winds. Lastly, an existing law that prevented airships from flying too low over urban areas made it illegal for a ship to tie up to the mast anyway. (p 4) Thus, a combination of structural limitations, safety concerns, environmental factors, and legal restrictions ultimately rendered the Empire State Building's dirigible mooring mast impractical."
1501	16334	6	3	"In the story ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon, the builders of the Empire State Building faced an obstacle in building a dock for dirigibles. One of the problems they faced was that they did not have a suitable landing area. Paragraph six notes that it would only allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours. Also, they had realized that most dirigibles from outside the country used hydrogen instead of helium, which was more highly flammable, adding to the risk. In paragraph thirteen, they said that an accident could have been worse if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York, further highlighting the dangers of the proposed mooring mast. These combined factors ultimately contributed to the impracticality and eventual abandonment of the dirigible docking idea."
1502	16335	6	3	"The Empire State Building had many obstacles Building the Empire State Building and also allowing Dirigibles to land there. One of the obstacles was the expanded use in New York City. As said on page 2 paragraph 6 ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the Lack of a suitable Landing Area"". Another obstacle was use of mooring mast was Nature itself. Also said on pg 3 paragraph 2. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was Nature itself"". The biggest Obstacle was weather for an example On page 4 paragraph 5 ""The German dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast But could not get close enough to tie up because of the forceful winds."" These are further concluding examples of obstacles faced in allowing dirigibles to land near Empire State Building."
1503	16336	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A couple of those obstacles are, first, the stress of the dirigible's load combined with the wind pressure. This is happening because the immense wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, meaning they would have to ensure structural integrity nearly eleven hundred feet below. Another obstacle was the eventual realization that the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its intended purpose. The reasons for this should have been apparent before construction was even underway, making the plan impractical from the start. These significant challenges represent just a couple of the many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building encountered in their ambitious attempt to accommodate dirigible docking.
1504	16337	6	3	The obstacles builders of the Empire State Building faced was many things surrounding safety and money issues. Successfully docking the dirigible would mean spending over @MONEY1 more, to make arrangements to the building's structure. Also, there were many safety problems such as the highly flammable gas the dirigible carried, the danger of potential accidents to people below in the city, and the fact that it was against the law for airships to be flying so low over populated areas. These concerns ultimately made the dirigible docking plan impractical and unsafe.
1505	16338	6	3	The Empire State building faced hardships while trying to dock their dirigibles. The builders tried to build a docking station for the dirigibles, but the only problem they had was safely docking in thousands of feet in the air, as the height presented unique challenges. The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Winds in New York would also make it difficult to land, making the high altitude even more precarious. Another reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was the laws about airships flying too low over urban areas. Not only was it illegal, but also unsafe for the people below. Most dirigibles from out of the United States were made with a highly flammable gas called hydrogen, posing a significant fire risk. A German dirigible was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, highlighting the dangers of hydrogen-filled airships. The owners of the Empire State building relized how bad it could've been in a highly populated area such as New York, leading them to abandon the impractical and dangerous idea altogether.
1506	16339	6	3	"The idea of the Empire State building being used to dock dirigibles may seem ridiculous now, but upon its construction, this was the original purpose of the mast at the top. Of course, there are several reasons as to why this plan didn't come to fruition. First of all, there was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"", which would make it impossible to tie a dirigible to a building legally. Also, the high powered air currents atop the building would cause a docked dirigible to sway uncontrollably, making it a safety hazard. Finally, many non-U.S. dirigibles used hydrogen to fly instead of helium, and if a dirigible were to explode like the Hindenburg over the city, it would be incredibly dangerous for civilians. These reasons give credibility to the idea that the Empire State Building would not make a safe dirigible docking bay."
1507	16340	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to dock dirigibles at their building were that foreign dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen over helium, the winds at the top of the building violently changed, and it was illegal to fly too low over urban areas. First of all, foreign blimps using hydrogen are very dangerous due to the high risk that they will burst into flames. This only occurred to the builders when a German blimp Hindenburg caught on fire on May 6, 1937. After this tragedy, they ""realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" If the incident happened over New York City, many more lives would have been lost. More people would die, which would cause a bigger fiasco. Also, the winds above the building change constantly, which would make the blimp unstable. The article explains this effect by stating, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" The changing winds would be torture on the back of the ship. The front would be secured due to its tethering, but the back would be left free to sway and swing in the wind. Pedestrians below would be at a high risk of danger, making this idea impractical. Finally, the law made it illegal to even approach the building, nevermind dock on it. The article tells this by saying, ""... an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas... Would make it illegal for ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."" The builders simply could not use the dock unless the law changed. The law was made to protect pedestrians and innocent bystanders, and flying the craft to the Empire State Building would violate said law. In conclusion, the three obstacles stopping the use of the Empire State Building were the hydrogen gas used in foreign blimps, the unpredictable winds making the craft swivel, and the law prohibiting aircrafts from flying too low over urban areas; these combined factors ultimately rendered the dirigible docking plan unfeasible and unsafe."
1508	16341	6	3	Although the mooring mast due to hoist at the top of the Empire State Building was a well thought out plan, it provided some obstacles for builders. The biggest problem was safety concerns. Most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is a highly flammable product. If an accident, such as fire, occurred at the Empire State mooring mast it wouldn't be safe to take place around millions of people such as New York City. Another factor affecting building was nature's interference. The winds above were constantly shifting due to unpredictable currents. The only way to tie down the dirigibles would be to use heavy weights, but that would also be extremely unsafe to be hanging precariously above a densely populated city. The last issue was an existing law that prevented airships from flying too low in urban areas. This law made it illegal for ships to even attempt to tie to the building, therefore it made it nearly impossible for builders to proceed, making the mooring mast idea impractical.
1509	16342	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon, the builders of the Empire State Building were faced with some big obstacles. One obstacle was they had to make sure that the Dirigibles could dock safely to the mooring mast atop the building. They had to be sure that the passengers could get off and on safely from these airships, a novel concept at the time. Lastly, they had to be sure the building would not collapse when they made the mooring mast, a significant structural challenge. These examples show that the builders were faced with many obstacles when building the Empire State Building."
1510	16343	6	3	The building wasn't designed to carry the extra weight of having a dirigible attach to the top. And the dirigibles had to have weights drop from the back to keep it in place, that wouldn't be very safe to have lead weights dangle over @NUM1 feet in the air. The mast was built out of Glass, which could have been dangerous if a dirigible couldn't stop and went straight into the tower. Also, the electronic winching stations didn't seem like they would work too well, making the entire concept a risky endeavor.
1511	16344	6	3	"The obstacles The designers of the Empire State building faced was a law that was against airships flying low over urban areas. The other problems the builders of the Empire state building, faced was when The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. The first obstacle the designers had faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock was an ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever fly up to a building. The second reason why the builders faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock was in ""1930 U.S Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because forceful winds. They felt this wind would blow dirigibles to sharp spires. These are the obstacles the designers of Empire State building faced to allow docking."
1512	16345	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Al Smith (four-term governor of New York who headed efforts to construct the Empire State Building) was determined to outstrip the height of the Chrysler Building ""The architect building the Chrysler Building however had a trick up his sleeve."" He built a 185-foot spire and hoisted it to the top of the Empire State Building. Smith was determined to outstrip the height by placing a mooring mast at the top of the building. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" The winds would be constantly shifting the mast. ""But using these at the street level, where they would be clanging high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe."" Dirigibles couldn't dock at the Empire State Building also due to a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This made it illegal for ships to ever tie up to the building. In conclusion, builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles when allowing dirigibles to dock there."
1513	16346	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles in trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast on top of the building. The main problem was perhaps that foreign dirigibles don't use helium, they use hydrogen. Using hydrogen was a huge problem because hydrogen is extremely flammable. If a problem did occur, hypothetically, that a dirigible caught fire it would cause a threat to New York City which is highly populated. If the dirigible blew up the people of New York would not have enough time to get away from the blast. Another problem was winds. Winds can easily blow the dirigible off its course or worse into a spire on top of a building and puncture it. This problem was discovered when the U.S navy dirigible ""Los Angeles"" was attempting to reach the mooring mast. The captain couldn't get anywhere near the mast, highlighting the practical difficulties. These obstacles and dangers suggest the mooring mast is a bad idea, a conclusion the constructors later came to realize, abandoning the plan due to its inherent impracticality and safety concerns."
1514	16347	6	3	The Empire State Building faced challenges in attempting to build the highest building in New York because they wanted to be so big, and they had been working on it for so many years, requiring careful planning and engineering to overcome structural and logistical hurdles. This ambition ultimately led to its successful completion, solidifying its place as an iconic landmark.
1515	16348	6	3	"In the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are explored. One set of engineers here in New York was trying to dope out a practical workable arrangement, and the government people in Washington were figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast. The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frames. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below, requiring careful planning to distribute the weight. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation, ensuring it could withstand the immense forces. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework, a significant investment to realize this ambitious vision of aerial docking. These structural challenges highlight the complexities involved in integrating cutting-edge technology with existing architecture."
1516	16349	6	3	Based on the excerpt there are three reasons why there were obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One, it was too close to the city and not high enough to avoid turbulent air currents (short). The second reason is because the wind spun the blimp dangerously around the mooring mast, making docking hazardous. And the third reason is because German blimps were filled with highly flammable hydrogen, posing an explosion risk if near any source of ignition, while @LOCATION1 blimps, for safety purposes, were filled with non-flammable helium. Thus, numerous factors contributed to the failure of the dirigible docking experiment.
1517	16350	6	3	"During the construction of the Empire State Building's dirigible dock there were three major obstacles: the wind, the structure, and the safety. The wind was the most obvious flaw in the landing dock because of the rough wind currents at the top of the building. Landing perfectly on the dock was one thing, but staying there was impossible because you would have been whipped around. ""[@ORGANIZATION2 dirigible Los Angeles] feared that the wind would blow the dirigible on to the sharp spires of other buildings of the area, which would puncture the shell."" (paragraph @NUM1)The problem of structuring the mast to hold the balloon would also become a structural obstical because ""[they] couldn't simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof"" (paragraph @NUM2) To get the structure sound enough to land a dirigible they would have to do sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to the framework. Lastly, landing a huge metal balloon ontop of the largest skyscraper, over millions of citydwellers, even when they knew the balloons were highly flamable, was one of the reasons the mooring mast didn't work out. The inherent danger of mooring a flammable airship high above a densely populated city was a significant deterrent. Although there were two attempts of landing, neither succeeded, and now the mast is there only for decoration. Ultimately, the combination of these challenges made the dirigible dock impractical, relegating it to a decorative feature rather than a functional transportation hub."
1518	16351	6	3	"The builders and the architects faced many issues in making this project of extending the Empire State Building to 1,250 feet height. Though they planned their steps into making the mooring mast on top was unrealistic. It was unrealistic because this was never done before on top of a building. Another obstacle they faced was safety of the passengers and in general, because most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, which was highly flammable. This posed a significant risk. Another obstacle they faced was with the weather, because landing a dirigible on top of the building with fast winds due to the violent air currents was also dangerous for the people on the dirigibles and could've possibly hit other building by swiveling around in the air from the winds. The last obstacle the builders faced, was that their project was illegal, against the federal law because the dirigibles would be flying to close to urban areas such as New York City, so therefore be impossible to accomplish, as shown in paragraph @NUM1. In this paragraph it states ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed. This shows proof of the project's incapability to be built, ultimately rendering the mooring mast's intended use unattainable."
1519	16352	6	3	"Ultimately, it is evident that the entire concept of Al Smith at Empire State Building was strategically flawed. It was Al Smith's dream, but dream is not always reality. In theory, the Mooring Mast would be constructed to dock dirigibles. However, it was eventually revealed that a docking station on the Empire State Building would never be possible. The reason Al Smith's dream could never prove to be reality is because Smith and the builders hit many obstacles. One obstacle faced with the construction of the Mooring Mast was the location. When a landing zone is 1,250 ft above ground level, it is extremely tough to test and complete a perfect landing zone, much tougher then if it was on ground level. Also, with location is the safety of having such high wind speeds at such an altitude. It is that the higher altitude airships get the higher the air pressure and the ""violent air currents"" (according to period sources) airships will have, making a very unsafe environment. Next, another aspect of the location was the fact it was in densely populated New York City; if there were any mistakes, a great number of casualties would be expected. Lastly, a large obstacle Smith and the builders faced was technology; in the 1920's and 1930's the amount of technology and engineering was certainly unparallel to the technology prevalent in today's society. Thus, due to these combined factors, Smith's vision was not feasible, proving the docking station on the Empire State Building impractical."
1520	16353	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there is that Al Smith constructed a 185-foot spire inside the building to make it taller. By the 1920s the new airships called dirigibles were hailed as transportation for the future. They were like blimps but were filled with hydrogen and helium to make them lighter. In New York City, they had a lack of suitable landing areas for dirigibles. Al Smith added a mooring mast to the top of the building so they could tie the line from in front of the ship, aiming to solve this logistical challenge.
1521	16354	6	3	The planners of the Empire State building faced many obstacles when they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that a law stated that airships couldn't fly too low over cities, meaning they couldn't dock at the Empire State building. Another obstacle was that foreign blimps used hydrogen instead of helium to fly, and hydrogen is very flammable, so using hydrogen blimps in New York City would create public safety issues. Finally, nature would prove to be the greatest obstacle because of wind, which could get quite violent at that height and cause the blimps to possibly get untied from the building or fall. In conclusion, there were many obstacles that the planners of the Empire State building faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there.
1522	16355	6	3	The workers faced many obstacles in the process of building the mooring mast. The first reason was because of the High Winds. These winds blew the dirigibles two-and-frow, making it difficult to maintain a steady approach. It would be cotastrophic if an accident occurred during the docking procedure. Secondly, The Law stood in the way of this idea. A law in New York was passed, that prevented dirigibles from flying over urban areas, thus restricting access to the mooring mast. The reasoning behind the law was because of a german dirigible accident in New Jersey. Lastly, and probably the simpilest, There was no clear way to land! The landing gear had not been invented yet, so it was too risky to even attempt landing on the mast. In conclusion, this idea was way ahead of its time, which is both good and bad in most ways.
1523	16356	6	3	The builders of the @ORGANIZATION2 many obstacles. Al smith realized that he was close to losing the title of the world's tallest building. The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. A mooring mast was added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling. Dirigibles were docked by means of an electric whinch. The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof; they encountered structural challenges. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in back with lead weights. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area, all though two dirigibles did attempt to reach the building before the entire idea was dropped. Fearing that the wind blow the dirigible onto other buildings, the mooring mast idea was ultimately abandoned, showing that despite innovative engineering, environmental factors proved insurmountable.
1524	16357	6	3	"The dream of the aviation pioneers of docking their dirigibles on the Empire State Building, created obstacles for the builders to face. The mooring mast of the building ""was destined to never fulfill its purpose,"" the author implying that the building should not have been built, because of all these obscured obstacles. One obstacle they faced was the violent winds on top of the building, due to air currents that made maneuvering difficult. It was difficult for the dirigibles to dock. The ""four-blocks"" length blimp, filled with helium and hydrogen, would be dangling high above, which was not safe for the millions of people on the streets below. In December 1930, the dirigible Los Angeles could not get close enough to the mooring mast because of forceful winds, highlighting the impracticality of the design. Another obstacle the builders faced was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas, further restricting access. The Columbia blimp tried to deliver bundles of newspapers to the building, ending up with papers dangling on the rope from the blimp, because the dirigible mooring equipment was never installed, proving the entire concept flawed. Therefore it was ""desirable to postpone to a later date that the final installation of the landing gear"" that ultimately gave airplanes the title of ""transportation of the future,"" as the impracticality of dirigible docking became increasingly apparent."
1525	16358	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building came upon some problems when putting in the dock for dirigibles. First, the sheer height of the building makes catching the dirigibles dangerous because of the tower's structure creating strong and unpredictable wind currents. If the dirigible was to crash, it would be falling onto a big citie's streets, posing a significant risk to pedestrians and property. Finally, most dirigibles were filled with hydrogen and that is highly flammable, creating a substantial fire hazard in the event of a leak or accident. That is why the mooring mast was dangerous, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the ambitious plan.
1526	16359	6	3	The Mooring Mast has two obstacles: first, the winds on top of the building are constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The other reason dirigibles could not moor at the building was the @ORGANIZATION1 law against airship flying too low over urban area. They try to get close, but they can't because of forceful winds. In nineteen thirty the @ORGANIZATION3 dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring but could not get close. So they established a law to ensure security for urban areas, effectively ending the possibility of mooring at the mast.
1527	16360	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, there were many obsticles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obsticle is that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This could be a big threat to the nearby pedestrians and the surrounding infrastructure. Furthermore, an additional obsticle is ""nature itself"". The winds are constantly changing, creating unpredictable conditions which is dangerous for the dirigibles attempting to dock safely. One last example of an obsticle is ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This would be dangerous if the dirigible lost control and harmed a pedestrian or damaged property. These are some examples in the article of how there were many obsticles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, highlighting the complexities of integrating this technology into an urban environment."
1528	16361	6	3	"Builders in The Mooring @CAPS1 by @ORGANIZATION2 face many obstacles when working to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. In order to ensure safety and eliminate problems involving the stress load and pressure of the dirigible on the building, the building would need ""to be modified and strengthened to accommodate"" the blimps, and these modification would cost up to sixty thousand dollars. Many of the blimps were filled with hydrogen, an extremely flammable substance that could put the building and the City of New York in great danger if a dirigible were to blow up. Because winds ""on the top of the building are constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" there was difficulty controlling dirigibles and keeping blimps still to keep passengers safe during boarding and deboarding. There was also a law against the height of airships in urban areas. Using the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building would result in breaking the law since the Mast was too low and violated existing airship height regulations. These difficult obstacles proved too difficult to overcome, and ultimately contributed to the mooring mast not being seriously used by dirigibles."
1529	16362	6	3	It was very difficult for the builders of the Empire State Building to allow dirigibles to dock there. They had to face many obstacles along the way. One obstacle was that they kept trying to make the building higher. Al Smith was very competitive with the architect who was constructing the Chrysler Building which was also in New York City. Smith wanted it larger, and by extending it, it became more dangerous and difficult to allow docks up there. Another obstacle was the weather at the top of the building. The winds at that height were very rigorous, and with a highly populated area, they did not want an accident to occur; even the mooring mast itself presented structural challenges. Ultimately, the combination of height, weather, and structural concerns meant that allowing docks up on the Empire State Building was very dangerous and impractical.
1530	16363	6	3	"New York is said to be, ""the city that never sleeps."" The people of New York are always awake, rushing about in the streets. When four-term governor, Al Smith, wanted to put up a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, these people of New York had many concerns, along with the people whom were constructing the building. These concerns consisted of laws, safety and construction. If a mooring mast was built, a law they'd have to worry about would be flying airships too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up the building or even come close to the area. Another major worry was safety, especially considering that these dirigibles contained highly flammable hydrogen. If a dirigible had caught fire above New York City, the damage could be tragic, with potential for widespread destruction and loss of life. The construction of the mast was also out of the question because the building's design never planned on making it prior to starting the project. Overall, the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building was never really destined to have been created. Too many factors and obstacles were in the way after the idea of creating the mooring mast began, making the ambitious plan ultimately unfeasible."
1531	16364	6	3	"The builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. They had to find a way to keep the dirigibles from spinning around the top of the tower. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This meant the dirigibles would swivel around the mast unless tied down securely. The next problem or obstacle was making the building's structure strong enough to withstand the tension caused by the dirigibles pulling against it. ""Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework,"" reinforcing the structure to handle the immense forces involved. The next challenge was to create a safe environment for the pedestrians below. That was not possible because the city was already made below. The dirigibles ""would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street"" was neither practical nor safe, posing significant risks to those on the ground. Clearly, the builders faced formidable obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building."
1532	16365	6	3	The builders, faced with the challenge, carefully reviewed the blueprints and meticulously planned each phase of the construction. They considered factors such as material availability and weather conditions.
1533	16366	6	3	Al Smith and his workers went through quite a bit while working on this building. As an example, while building it they had to transmit the stress of the dirigibles' load all the way to the building's foundation, which was around eleven hundred feet below. After that, they would have to modify and strengthen the frame of the building to accommodate the new situation. The greatest obstacle throughout the whole process though was nature itself. Due to violent air currents, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting. Safety was a major obstacle Smith had to face while building this building. Smith thought a dirigible would be okay to use on the building, but little did he know how dangerous using one could be. Due to the fact most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION1 used hydrogen rather than helium, using hydrogen meant HIGHLY flammable conditions, creating significant risks for the entire project. This combination of engineering challenges and safety concerns made the construction a truly remarkable feat.
1534	16367	6	3	"In the novel the CHALLENGES of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were significant, Because in the novel it said ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" This quote said that the dirigible would add stress to the building and INCREASE the risk of collapsing. Therefore, the structural integrity of the building was a major concern."
1535	16368	6	3	They faced many problems when trying to dock there. It should never have been made in the first place. Too many things were predictable. They had no landing gear, the wind was too great a factor, and the ships couldn't get close enough to the mast to dock. The people creating this overlooked the possibility of it not working and only looked toward building it. They had no landing gear whatsoever, so it was hard to steady it and dock it. The wind was unpredictable and swung the balloon around significantly. The biggest thing was when they slowed it down, and there was little wind; it still couldn't get close enough to dock with the mast, rendering the whole endeavor quite impractical. Those are the principal problems they faced, ultimately proving the project's inherent flaws.
1536	16369	6	3	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building had to face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The dirigible's weight was held by a single cable tether that ""have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation,"" which was far below. If the cable tether were to ever break, passengers in the dirigible and civilians of New York would be in grave danger. This cable tether would be too risky to use. The builders could not possibly overcome nature and its ""violent air currents"" for the winds they encountered at the top of the building. These currents would cause docking to potentially be too time-consuming and dangerous. The builders and architects tried to reverse this obstacle by weighing down ""the back with lead weights."" This was ""neither practical or safe,"" because of the potential danger of the weights falling and hitting New York pedestrians. The builders and architects of this grand project had to quarrel with many gargantuan obstacles in order to dock at the Empire State Building, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the dirigible docking idea due to safety concerns and impracticality."
1537	16370	6	3	some of the obstacles the builders went through was that they had to make many changes, such as they could not just drop a mast on top of the building's flat roof. The blimp would give the building stress held by a single cable. The blimp's load and pressure from the wind would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. The existing STRUCTURE could have to be strengthened to accommodate this new situation, costing over sixty thousands of dollars for the new frame work, demonstrating the complexities and unexpected costs involved in adapting existing structures to accommodate novel technologies.
1538	16371	6	3	Creating a mooring mast to sit atop the Empire State Building that would function and allow dirigibles to dock there was an incredibly challenging task for those who built the Empire State Building. Because the building was not originally designed to support the extra weight and size of a mooring mast, architects had to work to redesign the frame of the whole building. The architects modified plans to strengthen the steel frame of the building enough so that it could handle the added stress of a mooring mast. While builders were able to fix this problem, many obstacles remained that could not be avoided. One of these was the danger of attempting to control a dirigible, especially given the high winds at that altitude. Dirigibles were often inflated with highly flammable hydrogen which would threaten the safety of the citizens of highly populated New York City. Also, dirigibles were traditionally weighed down with lead while docked to keep the blimb from floating around in the wind. This could not be done on the Empire State Building because it would mean lead bricks would be dangling over pedestrians constantly. Besides all these practical obstacles, it was against the law for aircrafts to fly over urban areas, and that was the final obstacle that kept the mooring mast from being used, rendering the ambitious plan ultimately unfeasible.
1539	16372	6	3	"There were many obsticles in the process of building the process to build a mooring mast. The designers had to think they're way around them. It was easily known you couldn't just go up to the top and start construction. There were acomidations to be made. The exerpt describes, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation..."" Just adding it on would upset the buildings structure and foundation. Safety was a concern; more than just structural integrity. People realized it was a bad idea to have something as highly flammable as the dirigible. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium..."" After recent fires, it was noticed now dangerous this idea was. Control was an issue in the city; rather than an open feild. ""... the back of the ship would swivle around the mooring mast"". That wasn't going to 'fly' with most people. It would be almost imposible to keep it stable for people loading. Designers face a lot of problems in constructing buildings but in this case, with structural, safety, and logistical issues, the mooring mast just wasn't ment to be."
1540	16373	6	3	"The Empire State building was destined to reach new limits that had never been met or even thought of in the world of architecture as described in ""The Mooring Mast"" by Popular Mechanics was determined efforts in building a mast not only set the Empire State building at the tallest building, at 1,250 ft., though to also serve a useful purpose, was a radical dream supported with intuitive design and high goals. Unfortunately the reality in successfully completing this far reached destination was slim as problems gradually arose. The largest obstacle was ""... one of safety: most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is flammable."" This along with the fact that violent air currents at such great heights required that lead weights weighted dirigible down to prevent from extreme movement, served as serious caution the safety of the highly populated New York City surrounding the Empire State building. As practicality in the hopeful moore mast diminished it became... ""desirable to post to a later date the final installation of the landing gear."" Ultimately, the lack of safe and effective solutions meant the mooring mast's use ""quietly disappeared"", concluding the radical dreams."
1541	16374	6	3	Al Smith had a vision; to create a site for modern travel. Smith faced many obstacles and persisted with hard efforts in attempt to bring his vision to life. The stress of a thousand foot dirigible would have been too much pressure for the original framework of the Empire State Building. Over @MONEY1 worth of changes had to be made to strengthen the building's framework. In addition the builders had designed a mast that would be rocket-shaped, made with aluminum, which could accommodate the mooring arm, and the control machinery would be in the shaft; housing elevators and stairs for passengers on the dirigible. Another obstacle they had to face was the lack of floors that would serve as a boarding area for the passengers. They had begun to build additional floors with a glassed-in observation area and a boarding area, hoping to accommodate the expected influx of air travelers. Although the mooring mast for the dirigibles was a fiasco, Al Smith and many architects tried to make all the modifications they could have to fulfill Smith's vision for what he thought was the Empire State Building's destiny, even though the practicalities proved more challenging than initially anticipated.
1542	16375	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there according to the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted. First, they had to make the mooring mast safe for passengers to board and disembark. The architects consulted engineers to ensure secure passage. Another obstacle the architects had to work with was erecting the mooring mast atop the building. So, they had to add over sixty thousand dollars to the framework of the building to ensure its stability for the mooring mast. Once the mooring mast was set up and they ""celebrated framing the entire building,"" another problem emerged: ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" The winds were constantly shifting, causing the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast, making docking hazardous. Even if they had managed to overcome these engineering and meteorological challenges, the biggest obstacle occurred: dirigibles became obsolete and airplanes became the new mode of transportation. The builders of the Empire State Building faced too many obstacles and ultimately the plan to moor dirigibles failed."
1543	16376	6	3	As the builder's dream for the Empire State building grew larger, so did the modifications they needed to make. To begin, they needed to research and engineer a safe and practical way for the dirigible to dock. This was soon done with the help of navy and government research. The next struggle was the structure of the building. Adding a mast with the added weight of the dirigibles and an engine room at the top of the skyscraper would affect the frame. In order for the building to be structurally sound, the frame was modified to withstand the added stress, requiring stronger steel beams and a revised distribution of weight. Even with research and modifications, the docking system was never put in place. The strong and shifting winds above the Empire State Building would not allow for a blimp to actually dock safely, and so the idea was soon let go. Safety and wind were the two challenges that the builders could not overcome, ultimately preventing the realization of this ambitious vision.
1544	16377	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in the course of bringing Al Smith's plans to life. One of them was the fact that ""air ships flying too low over urban areas"" is illegal. If breaking the law wasn't a large enough obstacle, then the issue of New York citizen's safety also came into play. Most dirigibles were dangerous due to their flammability, as they were often filled with highly combustible hydrogen. So one wrong move could have killed many ""if it had [exploded] above a densely populated area."" Another huge obstacle that came into play was the lightness of the dirigibles, that would allow its rear to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast."" The only way to stop that would be to add heavy weights, which would again, put the citizens in danger, as the weights could potentially fall. These challenges highlight the complexities involved in realizing ambitious architectural visions, particularly when balancing innovation with public safety and existing regulations."
1545	16378	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced were that they had to make it strong and structurally sound. Also, they had to be sure that the dirigibles wouldn't destroy the building when landing on the mooring mast. They also had to be careful that the dirigibles wouldn't crash into the building while dropping off mail and newspapers. Another obstacle for the workers was ensuring the dirigibles would be able to land easily and safely. Finally, they would have to make sure that everything was in place and working correctly to accommodate the airships.
1546	16379	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in the attempt to allow blimps to dock on the building. The engineers realized from the start that even if they could get a blimp docked, it would put additional stress on the building's structure. To fix this, they had to reinforce the entire building. In addition to this, the docking of a blimp was dangerous in itself, especially considering the high winds at that altitude. It could easily be destroyed like the Hindenburg, rendering the entire docking concept impractical and ultimately leading to its abandonment.
1547	16380	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles, especially with the construction of the mooring mast due to the building's unprecedented height. First, due to the alleged, projected height of the mast, there were concerns about how to evenly distribute the dirigible's weight across the building's structure. The very nature of the dirigible, and the fact that it was lighter than air, was crucial to understand in the planning process. Taking this into account, the builders had to figure out how to have the whole building support the dirigible's weight and not just the top mast, a feat of structural engineering. Had the dirigible been supported by only the mast itself, the dirigible's weight would probably have pulled the mast right out of the building, causing a catastrophe. Another obstacle the builders faced was the delicate nature of the mooring mast's design. The mast was not made in a strictly utilitarian fashion, but more of an extravagant architectural statement, with much of it comprised of glass because of the inclusion of many windows throughout the structure. This aesthetic choice made the mast's installation a lot more difficult, requiring extreme care and precision as they carefully monitored the mast being installed from all angles. Therefore, the builders faced numerous and significant obstacles in ensuring that the Empire State Building was structurally sound and practically acceptable for dirigible docking, a challenge that ultimately defined the innovative spirit of the era.
1548	16381	6	3	"When faced with the prospect of building the tallest building in the world, Al Smith refused to give up. In order to achieve his goal, he decided to build a Dirigible docking mast atop his new creation. But with this genius idea came obstacle after obstacle, preventing the idea from ever taking flight. One obstacle faced by Al Smith, and by far the greatest, was safety. Most non-American Dirigibles used hydrogen within their Dirigibles, which is highly flammable. The owners of the Empire State Building realized how bad it would have been if a fiery explosion happened ""above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"". Another great obstacle was nature itself. ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". This made it impossible for the Dirigible to be tethered without the back of ship swireling around the mooring mast, ultimately proving the impracticality of the ambitious plan."
1549	16382	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were safety issues, nature itself, and the law. Safety was a big issue when it came to dirigibles docking over a populated areas such as New York City. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used Hydrogen rather than helium, and Hydrogen is highly flammable."" After an accident in New Jersey the owners of the Empire State Building realized this accident would have been much worse if it were it New York City. Nature causes lots of obstacles inlife, like wind which made it very hard to dock a big dirigible. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were teathered to the mooring mast, the back of ship would swivil around."" They would be dangling high above people which would not be safe. There is a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" Two dirigibles attempted to reach the building before the law was dropped. Safety, nature, and the law kept Al's dream from coming true. These obstacles were the ones the builders faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, ultimately rendering the ambitious mooring mast project a failed endeavor."
1550	16383	6	3	"The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building flat roof. When they tried to build it, there was not enough space, so they tried to force it, but that ultimately messed everything up. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, without stress to the building's frame,"" was the ambitious claim. At times, they tried to add things that only made the building heavier and more likely to fall. They tried to add more things only to make it look better, but what they didn't know is that it was only going to fall more, making the entire project inherently unstable and far more dangerous."
1551	16384	6	3	The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, further complicating matters in conjunction with the law against airships flying too low over urban areas, thus making docking a dangerous and challenging maneuver.
1552	16385	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted shares some of the obstacles that were dealt with when trying to make it possible for blimps to land atop the Empire State Building. L¸sted discusses the obstacles of nature, safety, laws, and construction in ""The Mooring Mast"". Nature presented a huge setback in terms of docking dirigibles, especially the unpredictable winds at that altitude. As L¸sted writes, ""even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"". The safety of docking blimps on the Empire State Building also became an issue, considering the potential for disaster in a crowded urban environment. ""The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse ""an accident could be if it happened above downtown New York, instead of in a field."" The laws in affect of the time made it illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas, further complicating the docking process. This law makes docking a dirigible impossible in New York City. The construction alone of accommodating a mooring mast required ""over @NUM1 dollars worth of modifications"" and a lot of time and planning, including reinforcing the building's structure. As L¸sted says, ""The mooring mast of The Empire State Building was destined to never fufill its purpose"". The obstacles presented in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building were too great and too many. The laws, safety, construction, and nature of the time were too big a setback for this endeavor, ultimately rendering the mooring mast an unused feature of the iconic skyscraper."
1553	16386	6	3	There are a few obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle would be the building of the mooring mast to be added to the top of the building. Although it was a good idea, it was very complicated. Another reason consists of law. There was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. New York is definitely not the city for this idea just because there are a lot of people walking around the city and there are many buildings around. This idea of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building would come to be over with the invention of airplanes. The idea soon disappeared.
1554	16387	6	3	Al Smith's idea of making the Empire State Building bigger was a very difficult task. Also tying to make the top of the building a docking area for new airships was difficult. One obstacle the builders faced attempting to create a dock for dirigibles was preventing stress to the building's frame. If the builders wanted to fix that it would involve the building's foundation, which was eleven hundred feet below. The framework reinforcement of the building would cost too much money. The stress on the building would come from the dirigibles' load and wind pressure. Another obstacle that the builders faced was the wind. The violent air current would cause the building to constantly shift. They didn't want to use lead weights because they were too dangerous, as they would be dangling high over pedestrians. A law that builders had to think about while building this was the law that went against airships flying too low. They had many obstacles that the builders had to keep in mind while building the dock, making the airship docking idea ultimately unfeasible.
1555	16388	6	3	"The main obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building had to face were mainly safety and nature itself. Safety was most important, and because they were aiming at having dirigibles land on top of the building, they needed to make sure it was completely safe. In the reading it states that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is flameable."" Because @CAPS1 it is flameable, the builders realized how much danger it could cause especially in a high populated area like New York City. The possibility of a hydrogen explosion high above the city was a risk they had to seriously consider and ultimately mitigate. Now besides safety, one of the biggest obstacles was nature. With having the mooring mask at a steep height on top of the Empire State Building came with many difficulties that revolved around the weather and atmosphere. The winds on the top of the building were always shifting, which would make it hard to land dirigibles. Because of the unsustainable air currents, nothing could be done about the dirigibles. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This constant rotation made the landing process exceptionally hazardous and impractical. Due to the roughness of the wind and the unidealistic design of the dirigible, safety and nature were main obstacles in the creation of the Empire State Building. These two significant challenges ultimately led to the abandonment of the dirigible mooring mast concept."
1556	16389	6	3	Builders faced many problems with airships to dock on the Empire State Building. The first problem they faced was the wind at the top of the building. When the Navy dirigible Los Angeles tried to dock at the building, the wind wouldn't allow it to get close enough without moving out of control, potentially hitting another building. This made it impossible for the dirigible to dock and so the Los Angeles gave up after several attempts. Another reason builders faced a problem with airships docking on the Empire State Building was that there was a law that said airships were not allowed to fly low over urban areas. This law would prevent any and all dirigibles from coming near the building and therefore they wouldn't be able to dock, rendering the docking station useless. Ultimately, these issues made the impracticality of dirigible docking on the Empire State Building apparent.
1557	16390	6	3	"In The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION1, many contractors were exceedingly determined to construct a mast on the Empire State building to sanction the use of dirigibles, or blimps, to be the way of air travel for the future. There were great amounts of obstacles in the way of making this a reality. Allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State building was a fantastic idea, but at the same time, proved to be just an impossible theory. The first problem was the weight of the blimp with the combined malicious winds, to eventually shatter the beautiful framework of the building. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" Architects soon fixed that problem when they impulsively spent over sixty thousand dollars on changes to the building to support this flaw, but this was not the only problem. The second major concern was the hydrogen that would be filling these blimps, especially those coming from overseas. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Hydrogen can easily create fires, which is a top concern in a densely populated city such as New York City. The most immense obstacle was mother nature, specifically the unpredictable weather at such a height. ""The winds on top of buildings were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" With dirigible flying above thousands of civilians, an uncontrolled aircraft due to high winds is not safe. The last impractical reason why this idea was not realistic was because of the law that forbade airships to fly too low in urban areas, further restricting the feasibility of docking. All of those obstacles made building a mast on The Empire State building only a dream. Al Smith, the architect of The Empire State building, came up with fascinating ideas. Although they were great, they did not work. Between the environment, winds, hydrogen use, and safety laws, his dream was just a hoax. These obstacles made it impossible to proceed construction. Al Smith had amazing imagination with bad luck, ultimately leading to the abandonment of this ambitious, yet impractical, plan."
1558	16391	6	3	"In the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the mooring mast had to face obstacles that hindered the success of the docking of the dirigibles. First, the architects had to design the mast. They knew that the frame of the Empire state building would have to be strengthened to carry the load and wind pressure of the dirigible. Therefore, they ""designed the mooring mast and made changes to the existing plans for the buildings skeleton"" and planned for the reconstruction of the building and mast. Workers were excited with their plans and ready to watch the launch of a revolutionary moment. However, once they realized the many problems with their construction plan, they faced many roadblocks that prevented the plan to follow through. The use of hydrogen in dirigibles posed a significant risk; ""Most dirigibles... used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable,"" proving that the mooring mast was unsafe and could lead to potential accidents. Also, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"", showing the physical insecurity of the ship on the dirigible. Lastly, the law states restrictions on airships flying too low, and the dirigibles would be breaking that law. Even though builders wanted to provide a launching pad for the dirigibles and had an ideal design, there were too many faults that made the mooring mast impossible to bring to reality. Clearly, the builders faced many problems that could not have been solved in trying to allow the dirigibles to dock. The combination of safety concerns, unpredictable weather conditions, and legal limitations ultimately rendered the ambitious mooring mast project unfeasible."
1559	16392	6	3	"The idea of a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building seemed like a grand idea at the time of construction, but it had many obstacles to overcome. The builders first had to make ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications"" to the building's steel frame. This would reinforce the building against the pressure a docked dirigible would create, ensuring stability. Adding a mooring mast would not be as simple as placing one atop the building. So the builders constructed a huge stainless steel enclosure to house passengers comfortably. This enclosure also had an elevator and stairs to bring passengers to the eighty-fifth floor, facilitating easy access. Lastly, the builders had to complete the roof before framing the mast in steel, establishing a solid foundation. The concept of a mooring mast was ingenious, although the practicality was soon found to be extremely low due to weather conditions and logistical difficulties. Not to mention the fact builders were a thousand feet high, working in precarious conditions. This idea presented many challenges, ultimately proving the mooring mast more of a symbolic gesture than a functional transportation hub."
1560	16393	6	3	The Empire State Building wanted to allow dirigibles to dock on top. To do this they would need to build a mast on top so that the dirigibles could hook on to and refuel. They ran into a lot of problem right off the bat and kept running into them. The first problem, of many, was that they could not just plop a mast on the top because it would be too unstable and cause too much stress to the structure. To prevent that what they ended up doing was modifying and strengthening the structure as a whole, costing over sixty thousand dollars. Once they figured out how to equalize all of the wind pressure, they had to think of how to bring the dirigibles in; the answer was simple: electrical winches. The next problem was safety; dirigibles outside of the United States used highly flammable hydrogen and if that blew up it would not be good for the densely populated city below. Another safety issue was nature's violently shifting winds, and to solve the problem on the ground they would weigh the back down with lead weights to keep it from swaying, but doing that in the air over a lot of people could be unsafe. The final nail in the coffin to this plan was that there is a law forbidding airships to fly too low over urban areas, thus rendering the whole endeavor impractical and ultimately impossible.
1561	16394	6	3	"The obstacle that the builders of the Empire State Building face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were the winds on top of the Empire State Building. This is because in paragraph @NUM1 it states that ""the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This promblem would make the dirigibles swivel around in the air. Another obstacle the dirigibles faced is that they used hydrogen and Helium, which are highly flammable; this posed significant safety risks for passengers and the building itself. Therefore, the combination of unpredictable winds and the risk of fire made the dirigible docking plan impractical."
1562	16395	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced, such as the high winds and the challenges of docking dirigibles, especially given laws restricting low-altitude flights near urban areas. One obstacle the builders faced was the safety of the dirigibles anchoring above busy streets filled with people and high winds, raising concerns about potential accidents. Most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Therefore, any foreign dirigible anchored at the Empire State Building would pose a safety risk because the high winds at the top of the building could cause an accident, potentially endangering pedestrians. Another obstacle the builders faced was the existing law that made it illegal for dirigibles to dock at buildings because aircraft were prohibited from flying too low near urban areas, and convincing the government to make an exception would have been a lengthy and uncertain process, thus adding to the complexity of the dirigible docking plan.
1563	16396	6	3	The builders faced so many obstacles to dirigibles on the Empire State Building. One of the greatest obstacles was nature itself, like winds on top of the building shifting due to dangerous air currents. The back of the dirigible would swivel around and around the mooring mast, making docking incredibly difficult. The dirigibles dangling high above pedestrians on the streets, was neither practical nor safe for passengers embarking and disembarking. There was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, further complicating the matter. There were so many obstacles to moor dirigibles on the Empire State Building, making the entire endeavor ultimately unfeasible.
1564	16397	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles with trying to build a docking station for dirigibles. They first needed to make $2 million worth of modifications to strengthen the building to ""accommodate this new situation."" This however, was an obstacle they were able to overcome. The next problem was that most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is flammable, and after the fire of the Hindenburg, people realized how potentially dangerous this docking idea was. Another problem was the weather. High winds could cause problems when the dirigibles are trying to dock. To top off, this list of problems is the fact that there is a ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" CLEARLY, there were just too many obstacles for the builders to overcome, and the mooring mast was never successful."
1565	16398	6	3	The obstacles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building were severe. The greatest and most important obstacle they faced was safety. If a plan is not completely safe, it shouldn't happen. The Empire State Building would not have been stable enough with the winds being so powerful at that altitude, making maneuvering a large airship incredibly risky. Also, most dirigibles or blimps used hydrogen not helium which would be extremely dangerous if the blimp caught on fire, posing an immense threat. Especially in a place as crowded as New York, the potential for disaster was simply too great. This was another problem with landing a dirigible on the Empire State Building. Another obstacle was the wind. A dirigible could not land unless it was weighted down with lead weights which also was not a bit safe for people walking freely in New York City, as the risk of dropped weights causing injury was significant. These problems are the reasons why the dirigibles could not land on the Empire State Building, as the inherent dangers outweighed any potential benefits.
1566	16399	6	3	In attempt to make the Empire State Building higher than the Chrysler Building, the builders ran through a few obstacles trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was because of safety reasons, especially considering transatlantic voyages. Dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen, not helium. Hydrogen was more flammable, causing the builders to realize if an accident like when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by a fire in New Jersey it would be more worse if it was to happen in a populated area such as downtown New York. Known as one of the greatest obstacles attempting to use the mooring mast was through nature, specifically the strong winds at that height. If the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of it would move around and around due to the winds on top of the building. The practical obstacle the builders faced was by law, further complicating the docking attempts. An existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas made the plan unfeasible. Having to tie up the dirigible to the building would be illegal. But as years passed on the idea of using the mooring mast died out, and with it, the numerous obstacles that stood in its way, ultimately rendering the plan unworkable.
1567	16400	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The author stated, ""The greatest reason was one of safety."" Dirigibles used hydrogen more often than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If a dirigible were to catch fire or crash, it would be very dangerous over a populated area, potentially causing significant casualties and damage. Another obstacle was nature. The author wrote, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The wind would be too much for a dirigible to handle, making docking a risky and unpredictable endeavor. A final reason stating why they couldnt dock was because it was against the law. The story stated, ""... was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law made it illegal to dock, regardless of any engineering solutions. The dirigibles faced many obstacles that didnt allow them to dock at the Empire State Building, ultimately rendering the concept impractical and unfeasible."
1568	16401	6	3	Dirigibles had a top speed of eighty miles per hour, and they could cruise at seventy miles per hour for thousands of miles without needing refueling. Some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City. The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York was the lack of a suitable landing area. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself; a window on the top were constantly damaged due to violent air currents. This proved to be a significant impediment, hindering the practicality of dirigibles despite their impressive capabilities.
1569	16402	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, workers building the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles, or blimps to dock there. At first Al Smith, who headed efforts to construct the Empire State Building, was really trying to win ""... the title of world's tallest building..."" against the architect building the Chrysler Building. Then Al Smith had an idea that would make his building over @NUM1 taller than the Chrysler building. Al Smith decided he would add a mooring mast to the building to serve as a mooring mast for derigibles. ""The Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" To accomplish this, ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made..."". To ensure the integrity of the structure, ""The architects and engineers of the Empire State Building consulted with the experts..."" to make sure everything would be safe and in check. The builders went through such trouble, but ultimately, ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fufill its purpose..."". After so much work and effort, the mooring mast never got put to use because the idea of ""Dirigibles moored... at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe,"" rendering the entire endeavor ultimately unsuccessful."
1570	16403	6	3	In building the Empire State Building, builders had to deal with numerous obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle was what the dirigibles would attach to. Builders thought that by adding a mooring mast it would make docking easy, although they disregarded the building's foundation. The builders realized that the foundation was not nearly strong enough to accommodate dirigibles, so over an additional sixty thousand dollars was spent to make it stronger. Builders then had to brainstorm how passengers would board, along with a place for baggage and ticketing. To resolve this, a glassed-in observation area and open observation platform were constructed to facilitate passenger transfer. Another obstacle was the existing airship law for how low they could fly. The dirigibles clearly went against this law, further complicating the idea for using the mast for docking. After failed attempts at docking the idea went away, and builders realized the plan would never work, ultimately abandoning the ambitious dirigible docking station concept.
1571	16404	6	3	The idea of making the top of the Empire State Building into a dirigible mooring mast had been a good idea, and would have helped with the problem of there was no area large enough for the dirigible to land. However there were flaws in the idea that were not discovered till the construction of the building was completed. One flaw was the violent air currents that would keep the winds around the building constantly moving and would the move back of the dirigible around and around till eventuly the back of the dirigible would hit the building. The other flaw Was that most of the dirigibles was filled with a highly flamable gas known as hydrogen. If the dirigible had exploded and burst into flames like the Hindenburg in Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937 then the flaming shell would fall down on the people around the building. Even if the flaws had been fixed, there was already a law that went against the airships flying too low over urban areas and if the airships managed to land on the Empire States Building it would be considered illegal, thus making the entire endeavor impractical and ultimately abandoned.
1572	16405	6	3	"While building the Empire State building, the builders faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The original problem was figuring out how to get the dirigible onto the building, specifically how to lift passengers and cargo. After consulting with the Navy as well as meeting with the president of newly formed ""airship transport company,"" Goodyear Zeppelin Corporation, to discuss logistics, they thought they were past the rough of it, but there were many obstacles to come. Next, as they began constructing the mass, they realised with the height of the building, dirigibles landing would ""add stress to the building's frame."" The frame of the building would have to be modified to help fix this problems, and it cost over @MONEY1 to make these modifications to the mooring mast and reinforced upper floors. The prior two obstacles had been resolved, but the next bunch of obstacles caused the attempt, of dirigibles to dock, to stop in its tracks. Many safety problems posed as obstacles for the building team. It could be very dangerous, as some gases used in dirigibles are extremely flameable, like hydrogen. Another obstacle is the ability to safely dock, at such high altitudes, with ""constantly shifting"" air currents, creating hazardous conditions for maneuvering. All of these problems were amplified because it was even more unsafe for these problems to exist in such a populated area, increasing the risk of potential disasters. The build team was able to overcome some obstacles, but some caused too many potential problems to be fixed, ultimately rendering the ambitious docking plan impractical and too dangerous to pursue."
1573	16406	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First of all, a lot of stress would be put on the building's frame with a thousand foot dirigible held to it, so the builders would have to make many modifications to the building's framework. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" Moreover, safety was a paramount reason as to why dirigibles weren't allowed to dock there because of the highly flammable gas, Hydrogen that is used in most dirigibles. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Furthermore, nature was the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast. Violent air currents caused shifting winds, making the dirigible swivel around the mooring mast, which wasn't safe for the pedestrians on the streets below. These unpredictable weather conditions posed a significant risk. In conclusion, these obstacles made it impossible for the mooring mast of the Empire State Building to fulfill its purpose."
1574	16407	6	3	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was nature itself. The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making docking a dangerous proposition. Another obstacle would have to be that the builders didn't check the laws of the city because an aircraft can't fly that low over urban areas such as New York City, so this law prevented and made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. The last obstacle that the builders of the Empire State Building faced was public safety, and this was the greatest reason. This project put the public in danger because if a dirigible went down in flames over a highly populated city like New York City it would be catastrophic! For example, what happened to the German dirigible the Hindenburg did in Lakehurst, New Jersey then the accident would be much worse & many people would die, thereby rendering the entire endeavor far too risky to pursue.
1575	16408	6	3	"While building the mooring Mast, the builders of the Empire State Building struggled through many difficulties and issues. First they had to make sure the dirigible wouldn't tear down the framework of the building. Because the dirigible was so large and heavy the dirigible added with the wind would ""be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"" which was at the bottom. This had to be addressed, or the building would have been destroyed. Even before this, workers had to learn how dirigibles worked and how they could be docked on the buildings. They ""consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment"" just in order to learn how a dirigible flies and how it would be docked. Probably the most important thing the workers had to keep in mind was the safety of the public. This was very difficult to do, and unfortunately, it wasn't possible to build this mast so it would be safe for the public, ultimately leading to the abandonment of its intended use as a docking station."
1576	16409	6	3	The Greatest Obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was nature itself. The wings on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical or safe, rendering the entire concept ultimately unfeasible.
1577	16410	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted the builders had to face many obstacles while constructing the Empire State building to be able to allow drigibles to dock there. The builders had to face many obstacles such as laws and changes and the building itself, that was not thought about while the idea was accumulating. After creating the plan to add a mast on the top of the Empire State building a docking for Dirigibles, the new airships they finally decided to look at the defaults of the already developed plan. While the mask was being designed architects realized that you ""could not simply drop a moorning mast on top of the Empire States building's flat roof."" ""A thousand-foot drigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"". When the builders were constructing their plan they didnt consider the fact that the load of the dirigibles would add stress to the entire building, which was a significant oversight. ""The greatest obstacle to a successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" The builders realize that the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents and since the law was against airships flying too low over urban areas the dirigibles idea wouldnt be as easy to fulfill with all of the obstacles to over come. Thus, between the structural concerns, the force of nature, and the limitations imposed by air travel regulations, the vision of docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building was fraught with complications. The obstacles the builders had to face When attempting to dock dirigibles on the Empire State building were safety laws, weather and the building itself."
1578	16411	6	3	"The excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, describes the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, after the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire, the fear of such an accident occurring in a densely populated area such as New York posed a problem, because most international dirigibles used flammable hydrogen instead of helium. Another obstacle was the nature of the mooring mast, and the violent air currents that cause shifts in wind, making docking a dangerous proposition. Having a dirigible moored to the top of the Empire State Building, ""dangling high above the pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe"" (paragraph @NUM1). Also, there was an existing law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, therefore making ""it illegal for ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (paragraph @NUM2). The architects of the project were so excited by the novelty of the idea that they were blind to these potential difficulties, effectively overlooking the practical and legal impediments. These obstacles and unsolved problems contributed to the unsuccess of the mast, and the idea disappeared and was forgotten."
1579	16412	6	3	The builders faced a lot of issues to allow dirigibles to land on the Empire State Building. The builders had to be very cautious and careful when building the platform to allow dirigibles to dock. The dirigibles (blimps) were very big transportation machines that were made out of steel and cotton fabric that was filled with hydrogen and helium. Hydrogen is a flammable substance, which meant the builders had to be careful with power and electricity supplies to avoid any accidents. To allow a blimp to dock above @NUM1 feet in the air on the Empire State Building, they needed to reinforce the framing of the building, so that in any bad weather condition, the building would not collapse and would remain stable. Because of all these problems and the precautions the builders had to take, making the mast was a failure and was left for future transportations, perhaps to planes, ultimately rendering the dirigible docking idea impractical for the Empire State Building.
1580	16413	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle they faced was they to reconstruct the building to add the mast. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommidate this new situation."" The mast was an obstacle they had to face. Also, they had to face all of the safety requirements, which ultimately made the plan unworkable. ""Was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" After they figured out what could go wrong if they docked dirigibles the original purpose of the mast was not able to be fulfilled. Another obstacle they had to face was testing there plan to dock dirigibles, which proved unsuccessful. ""U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up."" The dirigible failed in their attempt, demonstrating the impracticality of the concept, and the idea of docking dirigibles disappeared in the late 1930's. The numerous challenges and failed attempts highlight the significant obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in their ambition to accommodate dirigibles."
1581	16414	6	3	"The architects of the Empire State Building faced many safety & practical obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock on top of it. For example, dirigibles outside of the United States were filled with hydrogen, rather than helium, gas. Hydrogen gas is highly flammable. Therefore, the German dirigible the ""Hindenburg"" was destroyed by a fire in 1937. The architects of the Empire State Building foresaw that this could have been a much more tragic event if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. Furthermore, anchoring a 700 foot dirigible to the top of a building with a single tether would add stress to the building's frame. In order to solve this problem, the architects would have to make millions in modifications to the building's steel frame. Additionally, there are violent & unpredictable winds above the Empire State Building. If a dirigible were tethered to the mast, it would swivel around the top of the building with the wind currents. When moored in open fields, dirigibles can be anchored with weights. However, dangling weighted anchors above the heads of pedestrians could be potentially dangerous. In 1930, the U.S. Navy dirigible ""Los Angeles"" tried to moor the Empire State Building, but couldn't get close enough to the spire to tie itself up because of sharp winds. The pilot had to maneuver around other spires as well, for fear of puncturing the dirigible. Clearly, there were practical & safety reasons why the dirigible moor was unable to be completed at the top of the Empire State Building, ultimately rendering the ambitious plan unfeasible."
1582	16415	6	3	Al Smith and his group of architects encountered many problems when they attempted to build a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building in order to dock dirigibles. Before they began building, the architects realized that they could not land a dirigible on the building's flat roof. They had to make over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications to the framework before they could think of docking dirigibles there. After they finished building the conical top of the Empire State Building, the team working on the project realized that dirigibles could never be docked at the Empire State Building for several reasons. First, landing dirigibles was dangerous to the people of the city. Dirigibles contained hydrogen, which is highly flammable, and if there was an accident like the Hindenburg in New York City, the damage would be devastating. Nature also prevented dirigibles from docking at the Empire State Building; air currents were too powerful, and if the ship did land, it would swivel around the spire of the building. It was possible to prevent this by putting lead weights into the back of the dirigible, but this was also unsafe for the people that lived underneath. The last obstacle the architects faced was an existing law that prevented airships from flying too low over urban areas. Thus, despite the initial enthusiasm and the significant investment, the mooring mast ultimately proved impractical due to safety concerns, natural forces, and legal restrictions. Although the architects had a great idea, they never realized why it would not work until after building.
1583	16416	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For one, most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, so it could explode. For instance, on May 6, 1937 the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, a stark reminder of the dangers. There is no predicting that that could never happen again. The greatest obstacle in attempting dirigibles to dock there was nature itself. The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, and even if it was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast, making boarding treacherous. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using them at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the streets, wasn't practical and not safe for those below. Another reason is because there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, due to fear over the wind blowing the dirigible into other buildings in the area which would puncture the dirigible's shell and cause a lot of damage. Ultimately, these safety concerns and logistical challenges proved insurmountable, and the ambitious plan for airship docking was abandoned.
1584	16417	6	3	"In the passage The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One example is, ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building flat roof."" This is saying that you need to have a solid amount of support to hold a dirigible and the forces it would exert. Another is, ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States use hydrogen not Helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" So, if that were to catch fire in the middle of New York City, that would not be good, presenting a major safety concern. Another is the changing wind speeds would cause the dirigible to sway in the air, making docking a difficult and potentially dangerous maneuver. This could cause issues with stability, further complicating the docking process. So, in this passage, The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2 highlights the challenges that had to be overcome in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."
1585	16418	6	3	When something is getting invented or built, many obstacles are faced. The number one obstacle was safety for the people using the balloon. The wind at the top of the Empire State Building was another problem hindering the project. The actual building's design was also a problem too. All these problems and the architects tried to work around them, and failed to come up with a viable solution. Safety is incredibly important; if even one person dies per trip, nobody is going to go on the balloon. Safety is important, no safety means no business and the project will fail. The wind was a huge problem because of the potential danger. If the balloon won't stay still while unloading, it is very unsafe for the passengers. The skeleton of the building would have to change to accommodate the balloon's support system, and that is an expensive fix. These are some of the major obstacles the architects faced during the project. Maybe one day they will fix it, but until then, the balloon idea remains grounded.
1586	16419	6	3	"In The Mooring @CAPS1 by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State building faced obstacles in attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the main problems was nature; ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" which made it dangerous for a dirigible attempting to maneuver around the building high above pedestrians. Another obstacle that the builders faced was that the dirigibles used hydrogen, rather than helium, for lift. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and the owners of the Empire State building did not want a dirigible to catch fire above a ""densely populated area such as downtown New York,"" due to the catastrophic potential. The last obstacle faced in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas, a regulation put in place for safety. This law made ""it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area,"" effectively ending the ambitious docking plan. These combined factors ultimately made the dirigible docking plan an impractical and unrealizable vision."
1587	16420	6	3	"There were many problems the builders of the Empire State Building faced when it came to dirigibles. They faced problems with ""... violent air currents"" that flow above the building. These would constantly be pushing the ships as they tried to dock, and sway the back end while they were docked, making the process dangerous and unreliable. Another problem was that there was an ""... existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This would make it basically illegal to dock an airship on the Empire State Building, regardless of the engineering challenges. These obstacles described in ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia L¸sted show why the spire at the top of the Empire State Building was never used to dock dirigibles, as both environmental and legal factors ultimately prevented its realization."
1588	16421	6	3	There were many obstacles that stood in the way of allowing dirigibles to dock there. The layout of how the mast would be used was not carefully thought out. One reason is because most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, which was highly flammable. Due to the fact the dirigible would be relatively in close proximity with the pedestrians and other buildings, it would be unwise to use the mast due to the risk of explosion. In addition there was an existing law stating that the dirigible could not fly low in urban areas, which it would do just that if it attached to the mast, thereby violating established regulations. Also, the force of the wind could spin the back of the dirigible, causing it to go around and around the mast and creating a dangerous situation. The proposed solution to add heavy blocks in the back could cause it to fall on top of the pedestrians, creating a safety hazard. Overall, there were many reasons why it was unreasonable to allow dirigibles to dock there, making it clear that the plan was impractical and unsafe.
1589	16422	6	3	The obstacles which the builders of the Empire State Building faced to allow dirigibles to dock there were numerous for this project. The first problem was that other dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen. Hydrogen is a much more flammable substance than helium, which is what dirigibles in the United States used. The owners didn't want anything to occur similar to the German dirigible the Hindenburg, which would be worse in downtown New York instead of Lakehurst, New Jersey. Another practical reason why dirigibles faced problems docking at the Empire State building was that an existing law prevented dirigibles from flying too low over urban areas. For example a Navy dirigible named the Los Angeles, could not get close enough to tie up due to forceful winds. These problems go to show that owners of the Empire State building faced numerous obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there, ultimately rendering the concept impractical and unsafe.
1590	16423	6	3	The builders of the Empire State built two floors just for the passengers to drop off their luggage. These floors offered a view, but because the idea didn't work out, they wasted money on these extra rooms. They also started working on the build, attempting to make dirigibles dock on the top, but they wasted a lot of time and money, and it was just a waste altogether. Ultimately, these unused luggage floors and failed dirigible docking attempts represent costly missteps in the iconic building's design and construction.
1591	16424	6	3	"The Empire State Building was designed to become the world's tallest building, with a few tricks up its sleeve. The building was originally planned to also function as a mooring mast for dirigibles. Unfortunately, many problems lay in the way of turning this theory into reality. One obstacle the constructors of the Empire State Building faced was the use of dangerous gases in the balloons. ""Most Dirigibles from outside of Europe used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The use of hydrogen posed a dangerous threat to the safety of civilians in New York City. Another problem which was encountered with the building was the wind. ""the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast... (the dirigibles) dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" A third problem the builders had was the legality of the issue of mooring ships to the buildings. There was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. ""With this law in place it would have been impossible for ships to moor."" Although the builders had good intentions, they failed to realize the reality of the situation, and the dirigible mooring concept ultimately proved unworkable due to a combination of safety concerns, logistical challenges, and legal restrictions."
1592	16425	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, as mentioned in paragraph @NUM1, ""a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" The difficulty in having stress from the dirigible's load and the wind pressure is that it would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. Wind was another obstacle that the builders had to overcome. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. And even if the dirigible were to be tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast, potentially causing instability. Dirigibles moored in open fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using the led weights at the Empire State Building would not be safe, as they would dangle high above pedestrians on the street, posing a considerable risk. These combined challenges ultimately made the dirigible docking plan impractical."
1593	16426	6	3	Building the Mooring Mast was not an easy task, creating this futuristic design carried a lot of problems besides it. Some problems that these builders faced were that Dirigibles can be up to one thousand feet long so they are very heavy and sway in the wind dangerously, it was also against the law for airships to fly at a low level over urban areas, and there was also a great danger of the Dirigible crashing, or catching fire over the densely populated area of New York. Even though these problems almost seem impossible to pass, they were able to fix up some things to make the project seem more realistic. The steel frame of the Empire State building was modified and strengthened so it could support the Dirigibles and wind pressure, but nature had no mercy and would sway the Dirigibles vigorously which was not safe nor practical. They were able to bypass the law and attempt to dock once which didn't end up working out after all. There had already been cases of Dirigibles crashing such as the Hindenburg, whose tragic end highlighted the volatile nature of hydrogen-filled airships. But an accident over a densely populated area would be horrific and not practical. Because of these problems and more, including logistical difficulties and safety concerns that proved insurmountable, the thought of using a Mooring Mast to dock Dirigibles was quietly retired.
1594	16427	6	3	When the idea of a mooring dock for dirigibles first surfaced, everyone who heard about it seemed like a brilliant idea. But as time and construction went on, the surmounting obstacles that arose made the idea of a mooring dock stayed just an idea. When the mooring mast was finished, the obvious safety hazards stopped it from fulfilling its purpose. The greatest safety hazard was the nature of the mast itself. The winds at that height were strong, violent and constantly shifting. Even if the dirigible was tethered down, the back of the ship would be swirled around the mooring mast. Another hazard was that most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is extremely flammable. After the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized that they could not take that risk. A final obstacle that arose was a law that was against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to even come near the building. Ultimately, these converging factors rendered the mooring mast impractical and unsafe, ensuring that it never served its intended function.
1595	16428	6	3	The obstacles the engineers faced were those of any builder. You have to think about how high is too high, wind conditions, sturdiness of the frame, material costs, and payroll for the engineers. Although Al Smith did not run into the material costs problems he did have to rethink the Mooring Mast on if it was a good idea, putting a thousand foot dirigible dangling from a building 1,250 feet in the air. Al Smith created a landmark for the U.S., but perhaps shouldn't have put a non-usable Mooring Mast at the top.
1596	16429	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced a myriad of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. ""Most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION1 used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This meant that any little spark inside the dirigible would send it up in flames, posing a catastrophic risk. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents."" This proves that having the dirigible docked up there would be very dangerous and would call for weights to be used to anchor the back of the dirigible to prevent it from being swept away. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the empire State building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This symbolizes that it was against the law to have an airship that close to a highly populated area, further complicating the already risky endeavor. Ultimately, the idea of docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building was ignored, deemed too impractical and hazardous to implement."
1597	16430	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced natural opposition in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock in the building. Natural forces were a total threat to the idea of the dirigibles landing on the Empire State Building: ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" which wouldn't be safe for the people getting in and off the dirigible because the ship would swivel around the mooring mast. Another opposition to the idea was that most dirigibles that came from outside the U.S. didn't use helium, but hydrogen, which is highly flammable and risked the lives of the people who lived around the Empire State Building. Also, the law was against this idea. There was a law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. This law made the docking of the ships at the Empire State Building illegal, further hindering the ambitious plan. The builders of the Empire State Building confronted both natural and social opposition to the landing of the ships at the Empire State Building."
1598	16431	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was that the mooring mast had to be modified and strengthened. This cost them over @MONEY1 worth of modifications. They had to make these modifications so the dirigible could safely dock and passengers could disembark. All in all, these are the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock.
1599	16432	6	3	The builders had many obstacles to allow the dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was they had to make sure the building was high enough to accommodate the massive airships. They also had to make sure the building was durable enough to withstand the wind and weather conditions often associated with such altitudes. Those are some of the obstacles they had to overcome to allow the dirigibles to dock there safely.
1600	16433	6	3	"When allowing dirigibles to dock off the Empire State Building, they were faced with many obstacles. One of the many obstacles the builders were faced with was the Empire State Building was not well structured to hold a dirigible of @NUM1 ft, and the building's structure would need to be modified to at least sixty thousand dollars more to withstand the immense forces. Another obstacle the builders had faced was the dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, so hydrogen was very flammable. This meant they didn't want something bad to take place above the building and in a ""populated area like downtown New York"" due to the high risk of fire. The last main obstacle they had to face was the mooring mast was always buffeted by the nature around it, and the dirigibles would wear on it, causing danger to people in the town of New York. Those were the few obstacles the builders had on allowing dirigibles to dock near the Empire State Building, ultimately making the prospect impractical and unsafe."
1601	16434	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building had alot of problems in biulding the dirigible mooring mast. How Would they be able to allow dirigables to dock there? High Winds and laws stood in the biulders way. The fram of the building had to be renforced so it would not fall to the ground under the dirigible's weight. The landing gear date had to be postponed due to building scedual's. Whe a dirigible did try to land it couldnt. The air streems were too much for it to manage safely. In the end the idea was unrealistic. High winds and laws prevented the mooring mast from ever being used as intended, proving the entire concept unworkable.
1602	16435	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The greatest obstacle was safety for pedestrians and the building itself. Most of the dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is very flammable. They didn't want the dirigible to explode and fall over pedestrians and catch the whole building on fire, presenting a significant risk. Safety is the main obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced when trying to let dirigibles dock there, ultimately making the plan impractical.
1603	16436	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. @PERSON1 says in the excerpt ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" This shows that in order for the dirigibles to dock on the top of the Empire State Building, there must be enough landing space. If a mooring mast was added to the top of the building it would only allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours, for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on. One of the other practical reasons why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The architects also could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof, as the structural integrity needed to be considered. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, could add significant stress to the building's frame due to wind and the airship's movement. So the builders of the Empire State Building ultimately decided against allowing dirigibles to dock on top of their building, prioritizing safety and structural stability above the potential novelty."
1604	16437	6	3	"According to the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on its mooring mast. A large dirigible moored at the top of the building would add tremendous stress to the building, and ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications"" had to be made to accommodate the stress. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, winds would cause the back of the ship to swivel around the mast. According to the article, dirigibles could be weighted down to prevent this, but it was too unsafe for pedestrians below. There was also the issue with docking dirigibles that use hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. On May 6, 1937, a hydrogen dirigible was destroyed by fire, and according to the excerpt, the owners of the Empire State Building realized that if the accident occurred in downtown New York, it would have made the densely populated area too unsafe. The potential for disaster weighed heavily on their decision-making process. The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for there were too many obstacles for such an accomplishment to be made."
1605	16438	6	3	"The Mooring @CAPS1 the excerpt The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. Building a mast is more complicated than you would think; they had to take a lot of things into consideration like the dirigible's load and the wind pressure. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" This cost alone highlights the complexity. Just when the builders thought they were done, Al Smith adds a 250-foot Mooring Mast to the top of the Empire State Building, adding even more weight and wind resistance concerns. The builders had to go through a lot of obstacles and challenges to complete this project, but they did, ultimately showcasing their engineering prowess and determination."
1606	16439	6	3	Obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was nature itself. Winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast, making passenger transfer dangerous and impractical, ultimately rendering the docking plan unfeasible.
1607	16440	6	3	The workers that were building the extravagant Empire State Building went through several obstacle courses. One of the obstacle courses involved the imagined scenario of a blimp sitting on top of the building. Since the blimp, hypothetically held by only one cable cord, would be quite heavy, it would apply significant stress to the building's structure. Another obstacle was nature; the wind at the Empire State Building's great height was excruciating. The last obstacle they had to overcome was the choice of gas for potential blimps. The use of hydrogen, a highly flammable substance like that used in German blimps, could have led to disastrous consequences, highlighting the importance of careful planning and material selection during the building's design and consideration of potential future uses.
1608	16441	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was a existing law. In paragraph @NUM1 saying the reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building cause of an existing law against airship flying too low under urban areas, which essentially made it illegal for a ship to even tie up or approach the mooring mast. This presented a significant legal hurdle that, combined with other practical difficulties, ultimately contributed to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan.
1609	16442	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was ""the fact that the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). That would make it hard for the dirigibles to be tethered to the mast. Another problem they faced was the ""existing laws against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). Also, the equipment used to dock the airships hadn't even been installed, rendering the docking platform essentially unusable. These significant challenges ultimately made the dirigible docking plan impractical."
1610	16443	6	3	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in an attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there in the @NUM1s. The first obstacle was ""the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" If the builders had decided to that than the dirigible moored at the top of the building would add stress to the building's frame which could also jeopardize the lives of all the tourists who visited and everyone who worked there. There was also the fact that ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" Which meant the frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened; something like that didn't come cheap, in fact ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" Ultimately, the winds at that altitude proved too strong for safe docking, and only a few attempts were ever made. In all the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was a failure. The most obvious being safety since most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The end result is, today the rooms that were set aside for baggage are now the world's highest soda fountain and tea garden, while the highest observation deck has never been open to the public, serving as a reminder of an ambitious plan that never truly took flight."
1611	16444	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle that faced the builders was that the dirigibles could not simply land on top of the building. The thousand foot dirigible would add stress to the frame of the building. They would have to ""transmit"" the load and the wind pressure to the foundation which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The builders had to make over $2 million worth of modifications. Another reason was nature. As stated in paragraph two, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting"". The dirigible could not be teathered down because the lead weights would be dangling above pedestrians. A final obstacle was an already existing law. The law was against airships flying too low over urban areas. This made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building. These obstacles destined the mooring mast to never fulfill its purpose. Ultimately, a combination of engineering challenges, unpredictable weather, and legal restrictions prevented the dirigible docking station from ever becoming a reality."
1612	16445	6	3	"In attempting to dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building, many problems were faced. One problem faced was in paragraph nine where it says, ""A thousand foot dirigible at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" If they did build the dirigible dock, they would have to reinforce the whole building so it would not collapse. Another problem faced was, most dirigibles used hydrogen, not helium. Therefore since hydrogen is flammable they could not take the risk of a dirigible blowing up over a heavily populated area. A more significant problem was the weather, specifically the wind, at 1,250 feet. The air currents were so violent, that the dirigible would swivel around the mooring mast. Dirigibles usually land in an open field where they could be anchored by lead. According to the excerpt, dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe. Lastly, the most major problem was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. In paragraph 11, the law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. Even through the dirigible dock was a great idea, too many problems were in conflict with the mooring mast for it to go in full effect. On the brighter side, it made the Empire State building the tallest in the world."
1613	16446	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles dock there. One problem was that they had to strengthen the rest of the building in order to put the mast at the top. This process would be very costly, the author says ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" Another problem in the attempt of allowing dirigibles to dock there was the winds at the top of the building. The air currents were very violent that high up, making docking difficult and potentially dangerous. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" therefore it would not be safe for people on the streets of the city. Finally, the laws of the city interfered with the plan for the mooring mast. The law said that it was illegal for an airship to fly too low over urban areas. If the dirigible was able to dock on the mooring mast, it would be breaking this law, adding another layer of complexity to the already challenging endeavor. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems, and their plan never actually followed through."
1614	16447	6	3	"The Empire State Building faced various obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Most importantly was the danger involved in this ambitious plan. Blimps from outside the United States commonly used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, instead of helium. After a German dirigible was destroyed in a fire, owners of the Empire State Building saw the true dangers of an accident like this in downtown New York. Successful use of the mooring mast was another obstacle. The winds at such a high altitude made it difficult to dock. Once docked the dirigibles would have to dangle above pedestrians, which was ""neither practical or safe."" The existing law against airships flying too low in urban areas created further problems. After the Los Angeles failed to reach the mooring mast because of the high winds, the owners started to see the unsolved problems. By the late 1930s, the idea had ""quietly disappeared,"" as the dangers and impracticalities ultimately outweighed the potential benefits."
1615	16448	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, building a mooring mast on the Empire State Building was hindered by many obstacles the builders had to face. Firstly, the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would hurt the building's frame. Builders fix this problem by making ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications... to the building's framework"" (page @NUM1 paragraph @NUM2). After the mast's construction, two more obstacles arose. Firstly, most dirigibles used hydrogen, which is very flammable. After the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire, the builders realized the danger in letting that same accident happen in densely populated New York City. The mast's greatest obstacle was ""nature itself"". Since the winds on top of the building were always shifting due to air currents, the back of the dirigible would swivel around the mast. Builders thought of using lead weights to fix this problem, but dangling weights high above pedestrians on the street ""was neither practical nor safe"". The last and most obvious obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Though the builders and owners were able to overcome the initial structural challenge presented from the construction of the mooring mast on the Empire State Building, subsequent safety concerns, unpredictable weather, and legal restrictions ultimately prevented the mooring mast from fulfilling its intended purpose."
1616	16449	6	3	The people who built the Empire State Building had many problems building it. The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York was the lack of a suitable landing area. The Empire State Building was going to have a mooring mast at its top for docking these new airships, which would accommodate passengers on already existing transatlantic routes and new routes that were yet to come. This innovative idea ultimately proved impractical, but it highlights the forward-thinking approach of the building's planners, even if the airship docking concept never fully materialized as envisioned.
1617	16450	6	3	Some of the challenges the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are that they were to be docked by means of an electric winch, which would haul in a line from the front of the ship and then be tied into the mast. The dirigible's body could swing in the breeze, and yet passengers were intended to safely get on and get off the dirigible by walking down a gangplank to an open observation platform. Furthermore, the architects and engineers of the Empire State Building consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations at the U.S. Naval Air Station in Lakehurst, New Jersey, to better understand the practical considerations of such an ambitious undertaking, highlighting the complexity of the envisioned airship docking system.
1618	16451	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was cost, and saftey. The steel frame of the building would have to be modified, strengthened to fix this new situation and it would cost over @MONEY1. Another obstacle was that most of the countries outside the u.s. use hydrogen which is highly flammable. Another obsacle was ""The winds on top of the building where constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" this made it unsafe. These where some of the mayjor obstacles they had to go through, ultimately leading them to abandon the ambitious plan for airship docking, as the risks and financial burdens proved too significant to overcome."
1619	16452	6	3	In order to build the Empire State building, some of the workers endured problems while constructing it. The engineers and architects consulted first with the experts. The obstacles the builders had to face were, one the height. It was a thousand feet and it was putting stress on the building's frame. Wind pressure also added stress to the one thousand foot building. Another big obstacle was nature itself. The winds were constantly shifting to the violent air currents. Even when the mooring mast was tethered or tied up, the back part of the ship would sway from the wind, creating further complications. In the end, the author says or implies that it was never meant to be built because of all the problems that came with it, suggesting its ambitious design pushed the limits of what was feasible at the time.
1620	16453	6	3	"The future of allowing dirigibles to dock on the top of the Empire State Building became unrealistic when issues of safety came forward and when test runs did not go as planned. Some dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, which could be flammable. ""the owners of the Empire State building realized how much worse than accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area."" By placing a dock in the heart of New York City, it risked the lives of passengers and citizens. When the dock was in place at the top of the Empire State Building, two dirigibles tried landing, but both times it was a failure. There were problems landing, one being the wind. ""dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" These dangers stopped this plan from happening, effectively ending the dream of transatlantic airship travel directly to the city's center, as the associated risks proved too great to overcome."
1621	16454	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few main obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock atop the building. These three main obstacles were the designing of the mast and the building modifications, safety, and existing laws about aircraft. The designing of the mast was an obstacle because a dirigible moored to the mast would add considerable stress to the building's frame. The load and pressure had to be transmitted to the base of the building, requiring ""over sixty thousand dollar's worth of modifications"" to ensure structural integrity. One of the other problems was, most importantly, safety. The article states that many countries used hydrogen in their balloons to stay afloat, unlike the United States, which used helium. This was dangerous, for hydrogen is flammable, and the building owners certainly did not want a repeat of the Hindenburg disaster. Also, a dirigible had to be weighted down or it would spin around the mast, and the commonly used lead weights posed a hazard for pedestrians below. The last main obstacle for the Empire State Building's builders was the existing law banning airships from flying low above urban areas. It would have been illegal for a dirigible to approach the area, let alone tether to the building. These were three of the main obstacles the builders faced in constructing the Empire State Building and its mast. Design, safety, and legal issues all were significant obstacles which ultimately proved insurmountable for the builders."
1622	16455	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building had to deal with multiple problems involving safety. Because Al Smith wanted to build a building larger than the Chrysler Building he decided to put a mooring mast for dirigibles on top of his. The building's frame had to be modified before the construction of the mooring mast could begin because just putting it on top would stress the frame and bring it down. This involved reinforcing the upper structure with additional steel. Another issue was the landing of the dirigibles themselves. They could be weighed down when on flat land but not on top of a building; there would be many people below who could be injured if something went wrong. The high winds at that altitude also posed a risk. There was even a law against dirigibles flying too low over urban areas the builders had to work their way around. Ultimately, the biggest obstacle seemed to be ensuring the safety of the people both in and around the building, leading to the abandonment of the dirigible mooring concept.
1623	16456	6	3	In the process of building the Empire State Building the architects had many obstacles. One main obstacle was making the foundation strong enough to support the massive structure. Another was the wind factor, which posed a significant challenge at such heights. They had many problems in the building of the Empire State Building. In order for the dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building they had to strengthen the already substantial foundation. If a dirigible docked before the strengthening, the building would twist and sway dangerously. Another problem was the wind; the wind coming off of other buildings would spin the dirigibles at high rates of speed, making docking unsafe. Even though they faced many obstacles they successfully completed the Empire State Building, a testament to their ingenuity and perseverance.
1624	16457	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to add a dirigible docking station at the top of the building. As it says in paragraph @NUM1, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Wind could cause a serious safety hazard by spinning the back of the docked dirigible around. Also dirigibles are highly flammable; the hydrogen used to keep them afloat was a major concern. If an explosion such as the Hindenburg took place at the top of the Empire State Building it would have been catastrophic, endangering not only the occupants but also the surrounding city. Attempting to moor a dirigible at the top of the building was not only dangerous: It was illegal. There ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" (paragraph @NUM2) The fact that mooring a dirigible was illegal and extremely dangerous, was not the only obstacle that builders faced. It was also a daunting task. Builders would have to learn new technologies for operating the system at the U.S. Naval Air Station. After researching, builders realized that they would have to strengthen the frame. ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" (paragraph @NUM3) The obstacles the builders faced, proved to be enough reason to never use the mooring, rendering the ambitious dirigible docking station a failed experiment."
1625	16458	6	3	In their attempts to try and build a platform for dirigibles to dock at, the builders of the Empire State Building failed to note a few difficulties. One would be the way passengers got one and off of dirigibles. While anchoring to refuel and allowing passengers to get on and off, the rear of the blimp would constantly swivel, potentially causing gangplanks to shift dangerously. This could endanger the passengers and could possibly cause the dirigible to get damaged or destroyed due to collisions with the building itself. Another difficulty was the way the mast was built. It had a design similar to that of a rocket, so it was not possible for dirigibles to completely land. If it had a platform-like design, so instead of hovering dirigibles could land, which allowed for more stability and a safer transfer of passengers and cargo. These oversights ultimately rendered the dirigible docking plan impractical.
1626	16459	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast. The builders had to consult with experts and take tours of the equipment used in building mooring masts, land dirigibles service and a workable arrangement, and modify the building for support of the mast. In preparation to the construction of the mast the architects first took tours of the equipment at the Goodyear Zeppelin Corporation. The builders also met with the president of an airship transport company that offered their services across the Pacific Ocean. A workable arrangement had to be created. It was difficult and tedious to figure, ""on some safe way of mooring ships to this mast."" The foundation of the building had to be considered as well because, ""the architects could not simply dropping mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" Over $500,000 in modifications to the frame and foundation of the building had to be performed. All of these were obstacles in the way of architects building a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, demonstrating the significant challenges they had to overcome."
1627	16460	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle the architects faced was the building's frame. They needed to design the landing area so that if a dirigible landed there, it wouldn't add too much stress to the building's frame. Another problem was the stress of the load, and wind pressure. In paragraph @NUM1, the author says ""The stress of dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below,"" and that is why the dirigible's load, and the wind's pressure are a significant problem. Furthermore, this immense pressure posed a serious engineering challenge that required careful consideration. Finally, after the builders figured out that they needed to make various adjustments, also to strengthen the building's steel frame, ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made,"" which is a lot of money! This significant financial investment highlights the magnitude of the challenges involved in accommodating dirigibles. Those are the obstacles that the architects of the Empire State Building faced while trying to allow dirigibles to dock there."
1628	16461	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome many obstacles so the dirigibles could safely dock at the top to refuel or repair. People were thrilled for this idea, yet they knew how difficult this task would be. First of all, the building plan had to be redone due to the Chrysler building's builders tactic about sneaking around to make the building taller than the Empire State Building. Al Smith was not going to let that happen so he decided to make the E.S.B. even taller. (1,250 ft.) secondly, the builders had to come up with a way to build the dock on a stable platform because it was unstable on the flat roof. This served as and obsticle because at such a height, construction is hard to do. Al Smith was more than determined though which enlightened the workers stated in paragraph 1, ""over sixty thousand dollars"" worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework (L¸sted, 1). Also, the dock or landing dock, could not be used weather permitting. The dirigibles so close to the city, building, and civilians was dangerous when swaying around. The author says, ""some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City"" (6). There were violent wind currents that could make the dirigibles sway around the mooring mast. Last of all, an existing law against airships flying that low over urban areas was in place. This is a major contributor to the failed attempt. Being prohibited and breaking the law would get many in trouble. All and all, the attempt made by the architects of the Empire State Building proved dedication and good intentions, but their ideas were too irrational for the dock to become successful in society."
1629	16462	6	3	"In the excerpt from, ""The Airship Mast"", by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, it was mentioned that architects faced challenges when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One obstacle they faced was the fact that they used hydrogen instead of helium. In the excerpt it said that hydrogen is highly flammable and if something went wrong it could be a huge problem in a highly populated area like New York. A single spark could ignite the hydrogen, causing a catastrophic explosion. The main problem they faced was the nature itself. It said ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These unpredictable winds made it incredibly difficult for the massive airships to maintain a stable position. The dirigible had the potential to swivel around the mast and with all the pedestrians below that is very dangerous. The safety concerns and logistical difficulties presented by the volatile combination of hydrogen and erratic winds ultimately led to the fate of the mooring mast not being used as originally planned."
1630	16463	6	3	It was unfortunate that such a great idea was never able to succeed. The builders of the Empire State building faced with many difficulties when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the building. First they had to design the mooring mast, which sounds like a long and complicated process involving many engineers and architects. Everything seemed as if it was going to work out. Builders started construction. After two months of construction, the mooring mast was not able to fulfill its purpose for several reasons. Hydrogen is highly flammable and too dangerous to use in such a highly populated area, presenting an unacceptable safety risk. Things such as wind and nature itself would have made this wonderful idea impossible, as the unpredictable weather conditions at that height posed too great a challenge. There were laws that would have never allowed for this to happen anyway, due to safety and zoning regulations. If builders and planners had done better research, consulting with experts and conducting thorough feasibility studies, they would have found this project to have been impossible before going through all the intense construction, saving time and resources. Ultimately, the docking plan was an impractical vision from the start.
1631	16464	6	3	"The first obstacle that the can builders faced was the fact that the idea of the Empire State Building being the tallest construct in New York City had been shattered. This led them to subsequently face more obstacles as their plan expanded. When the design to make the construct of the plan was complete they begin to face more potential problems. The first being it was not logical or probable to ""drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof"" (line @NUM1). For, in doing this the amount of stress it would induce on to the frame would be monstrous, hence, it was concluded the stress would have to be transmitted through the building's foundation, which to the builders dismay was 11 hundred ft. below. This resulted in @MONEY1 worth of modifications to the foundation. Another obstacle that was faced was the wind pressure. The high winds at that altitude proved challenging, as illustrated when ""Los Angeles approached the mooring mass but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds"" (line @NUM2). This demonstrated the impracticality of using the mooring mast as initially intended. Therefore, the can builders had to contend with not only structural challenges but also environmental factors that hindered their original vision."
1632	16465	6	3	"While constructing the Empire State Building, the builders were faced with many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. To begin, there were dangers in allowing dirigibles made outside of the United States. Many non-American dirigibles were made up of hydrogen, which is much more flammable compared to the United States helium balloons. To avoid a repeat of the explosion of a dirigible, Marcia Amidon L¸sted states, ""the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above Downtown New York."" Furthermore, the winds at the top of the building were too wild to attach a dirigible safely. The author clarifies, ""Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around... the back could be weighted down with lead weights, but using these was neither practical nor safe."" This shows that in order to have the ship still enough to moor, it was dangerous. Lastly, a law was passed making it impossible to fly close enough to the building to moor. Marcia Amidon L¸sted says, ""An existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This essentially made the possibility of landing dirigibles on the Empire State Building an impossibility, both practically and legally."
1633	16466	6	3	One of the obvious reasons is the height of all this taking place. The strong, always changing winds were a problem because it would make the back of the blimp sway from side to side. Another problem was trying to stop the swaying of the ship; they consulted putting lead weights, but hanging weights above pedestrians is not safe at all. Another reason was, it was against the law to fly aircrafts too low to the ground. These are just some of the reasons why this concept was ultimately impractical and wasn't going to work.
1634	16467	6	3	Even beginning to build the dock of the Empire State Building was a mistake. What first appeared to be a worthwhile and realistic idea ended up being potentially horrific if it failed. One obstacle the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the law that did not allow airships flying low over urban areas. It would be even illegal to continuously have ships closely over pedestrians below. Another obstacle they faced was the unsafeness of it all. The winds at that height are constantly different and could cause the dirigibles to move around unexpectedly. Therefore, having airships dock at the Empire State Building was potentially dangerous as well as illegal, ultimately making the entire venture impractical and ill-advised.
1635	16468	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a lot of obstacles. One problem they had was determining when and where dirigibles would land, along with getting an area for people to embark and disembark. They had to make the platform bigger to accommodate the airships and their passengers. When the dirigibles landed, it was primarily because they needed more fuel; it would only be a couple of hours that they were stopped for refueling and passenger exchange.
1636	16469	6	3	"During the construction of the Empire State Building the builders experienced many obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that the builders cannot just drop a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State building. ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" Another problem the workers faced is they would have to change the entire design of the building to meet the accommodations of the mooring dock, which would be a costly and time-consuming endeavor. The largest reason why the dock didn't work out was safety. The author writes ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium..."" This means that the dirigibles are highly flammable and if one exploded over the densely packed New York it would have serious repercussions, putting countless lives at risk. All of these reasons are why the mooring dock never came to life on top of the Empire State Building, rendering the initial vision of airborne commuting an unrealized dream."
1637	16470	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obsticles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of those obsticles was that many dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen instead of helium. This was a problem because, ""hydrogen is highly flammable"" (para. @NUM1). Docking dirigibles that use hydrogen not helium had been proven dangerous by the German Hindenburg when it was destroyed in a fire, and if anything like that occurred over New York the results would be horrible. A second obsticle faced in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was another safety consern for the passengers. The point was brought up that ""winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (para. @NUM2). This would make it unsafe for the passengers on board the dirigible attempting to disembark. A third obsticle faced is the fact that there was a law against airships flying too low over areas such as New York. That law ""made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (para. @NUM3). Those were significant obsticles that the builders faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, ultimately making the endeavor impractical and unsafe."
1638	16471	6	3	"When designing the Empire State Building, architect Al Smith had the idea of futuristic Dirigible travel in mind. However, he faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at this giant building, as described in The Mooring Mast. Mooring a dirigible to the top of it ""... would add stress to the building's frame."" In order to allow dirigibles to dock, Smith had to modify the building's frame: transmitting pressure all the way down to the foundation, adding significant cost and complexity. Smith also faced the issue of foreign balloons; most of which used the highly flammable hydrogen, Instead of helium. A fire caused by a dirigible docked to the Empire State Building would rapidy spread to the city, creating a disastrous scenario. Smith found that nature caused problems as well. Due to the changing winds atop the building, ""... the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" endangering pedestrians. Because of all these obstacles, the ambitious idea of a dirigible mooring was given up, but the iconic mast remains today, a testament to a dream that ultimately proved impractical."
1639	16472	6	3	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced were those of: it was at a height of feet, how would the passengers be able to get on and off, takes a long time to slow down, and the building is said to be 102 floors high with an observation deck on the 101st floor and a boarding/observation deck on the 102nd floor for the blimp passengers. Some more major obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building had faced were some so intense they are hard to explain; those major obstacles were: how to dock the blimps and how many blimps could dock there at one time. These considerations highlighted the unique challenges of integrating airship travel into the skyscraper's design.
1640	16473	6	3	"In the excerpt, ""The @CAPS1 Mast,"" by @PERSON1, the architects of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the problems the builders encountered was that the dirigible didn't have a suitable landing area. The architects concluded that they couldn't just drop a @CAPS1 mast on top of their building, because it would add stress to its frame, so they had to strengthen and modify it to make it work. Another obstacle was the fact that most dirigibles ran on hydrogen, which is highly flammable. The builders realized how dangerous that could be, especially above a densely populated area such as downtown New York, where a spark could ignite a catastrophe. They also realized that nature itself was their biggest obstacle. Winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, and they knew that this idea was neither practical nor safe, as maneuvering a massive airship in such conditions would be nearly impossible. Lastly, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which would make their idea illegal and unsuccessful. Ultimately, the combination of structural challenges, safety concerns, unpredictable weather, and legal restrictions made the dirigible docking plan unfeasible."
1641	16474	6	3	@CAPS1, also known as blimps, were thought of as the future of transportation. @CAPS1 were like balloons except they were steel and had rudders and propellers to keep control. These steel balloons can ride eighty miles per hour. The main reason why the Empire State Building couldn't dock these was because most @CAPS1 from outside the United States use hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable and causes accidents, making it a dangerous choice for docking in a densely populated area. Ultimately, the safety concerns surrounding hydrogen use contributed to the decline of @CAPS1 as a primary mode of passenger transport.
1642	16475	6	3	When the construction of the Mooring Mast on the Empire State Building was completed the builders began to face problems that should have been apparent from the beginning. Some of the problems faced was there is a law in the U.S. that doesn't let aircraft fly close to or around cities and buildings. This meant they wouldn't be able to have the blimps tethered to the mast anyway. The highly violent and constantly changing weather and wind also posed a problem because it would be blowing the blimp everywhere, and it could not be weighed down with lead blocks like on land because it wouldn't be safe having them hang over the city. With the winds being crazy the blimp (most of them filled with hydrogen) could be punctured and set ablaze falling towards the people on the ground. With those being some of the most obvious problems some would think they wouldn't have attempted it, but those obstacles were never overcome and the mooring mast still sits unused, a testament to ambition clashing with reality.
1643	16476	6	3	"The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2 is about the Empire State Building and the expectations that people had for it. In @DATE1 it was announced that the Empire State Building would reach the height of 1,250 feet. The point of the selection is to show that there was another idea that the Empire State building builders were trying to make a reality. The builders came across some obstacles while trying to allow dirigibles to dock there, such as the building not being stable enough to support the dirigibles, having to add frame work, and the possible dangers of making this idea a reality. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would add too much stress to the buildings frame."". Because of this added stress ""the steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened."" Then when a dirigible was destroyed, the owners of the Empire State building realized how much worse it could of been it happened in a place such as downtown @CAPS1"". It is a good thing they did not do the idea, as the engineering challenges and potential for disaster proved too great to overcome."
1644	16477	6	3	"In The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The Mast was doomed to fail before it began. The greatest reason the mast never worked was because of safety. The hydrogen, in most dirigibles, is highly flammable. If an accident were to occur, it would happen over down town New York, endangering countless lives. ""The owners of the Empire State building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it taken place above a densely populated area."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) Nature itself was one of the greatest obstacles to the successful use of the Mast. Violent air currents and horse winds made it difficult to fly a dirigible near the building, making docking a dangerous proposition. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) Ultimately, the volatile combination of flammable gas and unpredictable weather made the entire concept too risky. The Mooring Mast was doomed to fail before they began building it. The greatest reasons for its failure were air currents and safety. The dirigibles were never able to land there, rendering the ambitious mooring mast a fascinating but ultimately impractical endeavor."
1645	16478	6	3	"While they were attempting to allow the dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. One obstacle they faced was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith thought if a mooring mast was added to the top of the building, then the dirigibles would be able to anchor there to refuel and let passengers off and on. Another obstacle that was faced was that dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, which was extremely flammable. This posed a serious safety concern, as the owners of the Empire State Building felt that it wouldn't be safe if the dirigible set on fire with a densely populated area right below it. The greatest obstacle that was faced was the use of the mooring mast with nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The owners of the Empire State building believed that if something went wrong then the dirigible would be dangling above pedestrians on the street, creating a perilous situation. Ultimately, these combined challenges proved insurmountable, leading to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan."
1646	16479	6	3	"Many obstacles took place while builders of the Empire State building attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. The stress of the blimps docking on the building would be too much for the structure. As such, ""the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation"". Another problem was that dirigibles were highly flammable, as they were filled with hydrogen, and in such a highly populated area of New York it ""was neither practical nor safe"" to risk potential explosions. Laws against airships flying too low over urban areas also worked against the idea, making approach difficult, but two dirigibles did attempt to reach the building despite these challenges before the entire idea was ultimately dropped due to its impracticality and danger."
1647	16480	6	3	"The construction workers faced many obstacles in building the Empire State building. One of those obstacles was height. Since they wanted to make the building the tallest building in the world they had to make sure there was enough technology to do so. Also they had to add an extra seventeen floors to the building making it 102 floors instead of its original @NUM1 floors. Another obstacle was its safety issues. The construction workers never checked into problems with building the mooring mast. In paragraph @NUM2 the author states, ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring air ships to a fixed mass at such a height made it describable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear."" the author is trying to say that when designing the production of the mooring mass; they overlooked certain issues that made them set back the final date. Due to these obstacles, the construction team managed to succeed in building the tallest building, The Empire State building, a testament to their ability to overcome challenges and innovate."
1648	16481	6	3	"The Empire State Building faced obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles, ""enormous steel framed balloons"" commonly called blimps, dock there. One of the main issues was the pressure on the building caused by the dirigibles. As said in the excerpt The Empire State Building: The Making of a Landmark, by The Empire State Building Company, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" (paragraph 7). Over $2 million worth of modifications were made to strengthen and accommodate for this new situation of dirigibles. Ultimately, the impracticality of mooring and passenger transfer, alongside safety concerns, led to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan, demonstrating the challenges faced in adapting innovative ideas to the realities of engineering and logistics."
1649	16482	6	3	One obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced in their attempt to allow dirigibles was that the stress from the mass of the dirigible, combined with wind pressure, would all be transmitted to the building's foundation. The frame of the building would have to be strengthened to accommodate this new situation. There were also safety reasons to consider. Since most states used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is flammable, there was a considerable risk. If something were to happen and the dirigible were to catch fire, the fire could potentially devastate New York City due to its dense population. The biggest obstacle, however, was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. If the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mast, making passenger transfer extremely difficult and dangerous. Ultimately, these factors led to the abandonment of the dirigible mooring project, highlighting the impracticality of the concept despite its initial appeal.
1650	16483	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. While designing the mast, the architects faced problems including wind pressure, safety, and practicality. The frame was not strong enough to undergo the stress and wind pressure from the load of the dirigible. The foundation of the building, which was approximately @NUM1 feet below, would have had to be strengthened and modified if it was going to be able to handle the movement of the dirigible attached by a single cable tether. Safety was the greatest obstacle that the builders faced; most dirigibles used hydrogen to make them lighter than the air. However, this hydrogen was highly flammable, causing many dangers. Since New York City is such a thickly settled area, the risk of a fire was too dangerous to take. Finally, instead of dirigibles landing in open fields, they would have to dock eleven hundred feet above the ground; in the words of Marcia Amidon L¸sted, ""using these (dirigibles) at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe,"" solidifying the impracticality and inherent risks involved."
1651	16484	6	3	There were three main obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there: the densely populated area, the violent air currents, and the existing law against airships. First, most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Since the dock would be above downtown New York, there was a higher risk of the dock blowing up due to the density of the surrounding area, making any potential accident catastrophic. Secondly, nature was a great obstacle. There were many winds on top of the building, and the wind currents were constantly changing violently. There was a gigantic fear of the dirigible swiveling around and hitting another building because of these unpredictable gusts. Finally, the dock could never allow a ship to be tied up legally due to the existing law of airships flying too low over urban areas. The dirigible would not be safe, and the entire idea would ultimately drop. For these reasons or obstacles, many builders of the Empire State Building faced significant challenges while attempting to allow blimps to dock there, ultimately rendering the ambitious plan unfeasible.
1652	16485	6	3	"The architects had their hands full when building the addition to the Empire State Building. There were considerable obstacles that needed to be overcome when they started building such as making sure the dirigibles were safe enough also taking in consideration the winds that are constantly changing. These problems were part of why the plans were put to a hault. Certain weather conditions were a big part of the safety procedures that took place. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" The winds would make the ship sway back and forth which would be extremely dangerous. Another problem was that some foreign ships ran on hydrogen which is flamable and that would be a high risk. Dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flamable. As a result, the challenges posed by both weather and the type of fuel used in foreign dirigibles contributed significantly to the project's delays and ultimate modification."
1653	16486	6	3	overcome challenges to @CAPS1 safely to allow the dirigible to dock on the @ORGANIZATION2 Empire State Building. The first thing that was a problem with geting it to the top of the Empire State Building was the wind, making it really hard to get the dirigible up there without it poping. There was also the safty concerns of it being up there, especially given that there was already a fire from another dirigible catching on fire. The gases inside are really flamable and that would make a really big problem. The last thing that they had to conider was if Airships were to Low, the dirigible would pop. For all those reason they had to concider them to overcome challenges to @CAPS1 safely to allow the dirigible on the Empire State Building.
1654	16487	6	3	"Having the Empire State Building dock and hold dirigibles brought up some hefty problems for the builders. Most of the problems resided among the idea of a mast, as Al Smith knew that the mast would put too much pressure on the building frame. Another issue was the balloon itself; besides the U.S., most dirigibles were made of hydrogen rather than helium. The hydrogen made it much more dangerous to have in the crowded downtown New York area because hydrogen was much more flammable. A third obstacle was the winds, as it was said that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" It was also illegal to fly, hold, or dock an aircraft so close to the ground. Therefore, the docking and holding of dirigibles at the Empire State Building brought many issues and dilemmas, making it hard to carry out such an idea for such a tall building."
1655	16488	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building were challenged with significant obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One example, was the architects had to address the potential problem of the ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law clearly would prohibit and make it ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"", thereby undermining the very purpose of the mooring mast. Dirigibles were designed to be ""moored in open landing fields"" and ""could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe,"" posing a significant safety hazard. Another example, of an obstacle that the builders of the Empire State Building faced was the potential risk to passengers and resident safety. The reason the landing of dirigibles were a potential threat to the entire population of New York City was that ""most dirigibles from outside United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The owners of the Empire State Building saw these potential risks ""when the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey,"" highlighting the catastrophic consequences that could arise. Also, another obstacle of placing a mooring mast among one of the world's tallest buildings was ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Due to the unpredictable winds the dirigible could sway and ""swivel around and around the mooring mast"", potentially causing damage to the building itself and making the docking process extremely dangerous. The architects of the Empire State Building were threatened by the possible obstacles of constructing a mooring mast atop the building, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the ambitious dirigible docking plan."
1656	16489	6	3	"Throughout the short story The Mooring Mast, the builders faced many obstacles to complete their vision. For example the workers had to design a mast that would take ""the stress of the dirigible's load"". The cable at the top was stated to not be able to maintain the stress the dirigible would produce, so the engineers had to develop a new solution to distribute the weight of the dirigible evenly. This cost them time and money due to the massive height of the Empire State Building, adding to the complexity of the project. The architects also had to do extra research to develop the mast, ensuring its functionality and safety. The workers took tours of the U.S. Naval Air Station and met with the president of the airship transport company just so they could be sure the dirigibles would land in a safe, secure way, and to understand the specific needs of airship travel. These obstacles had to be faced in order to produce their unrealistic dream."
1657	16490	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building had many CHALLENGES. One of these CHALLENGES was trying to get the frame of the building to support dirigibles, ""The stress of dirigibles load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted to the frame."" Another problem faced by the builders was that there was a law against aircraft going that low; this was stated ON PAGE 267, ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low in urban areas."" The biggest obstacle was nature itself. The violent winds that high up would have caused the dirigibles to be unable to moor, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mast."" These were the CHALLENGES the builders faced, ultimately preventing the building from becoming a successful airship mooring station."
1658	16491	6	3	The Empire State Building was to be the tallest building ever made. At the top, was to be an accessible docking station for dirigibles called mooring masts. The idea of having a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building caused the whole building to be modified. It cost over sixty thousand dollars in modifications to accommodate the mooring mast. This project was the first of its kind and had many obstacles like the modifications. Some of those obstacles included the violent air currents and constant change in wind direction on top of the building. With the wind changes, the dirigible could swing around and hit the building or other buildings and fall on the densely populated New York City below. The solution to this was to tie lead bricks to the tail of the dirigible like what is used in the fields when they land. Although the bricks keep the tail from moving around, having them hang over a thousand feet above pedestrians was not safe. In the end the idea of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building was disbanded due to many problems that could arise, as the practical challenges ultimately outweighed the initial ambition.
1659	16492	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there and those obstacles include: the lack of a suitable landing area in Manhattan, a mooring mast was needed to the top of the building so dirigibles or blimps could anchor there for several hours for fuel, services, and to let passengers on and off. The steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be modified and strengthened because a thousand-foot blimp mooring at the top of the building held by a cable tether would cause stress to the building frame. The blimps load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all through the buildings foundation which was somewhere about eleven hundred feet below. The last obstacle in the allowing blimps to dock at the Empire State Building was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas which would make it illegal for a dirigible to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area, ultimately rendering the dirigible docking plan unfeasible.
1660	16493	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced SIGNIFICANT obstacles in allowing Dirigibles to dock. The most blatant one was the height at which they would dock. Al Smith states ""The Empire State would reach the height of 1,250 feet,"" and THIS meant that any docking procedure would occur at a precarious altitude. Dirigibles from outside the U.S. Were extremly Flammable. If one caught fire while moored to the top of the Empire state building the results would have been catastrophic because it would happen over a densly populated area. Another obstacle was wind. If the ship was tethered to the mast the back of it would constantly Swivel around. USing led weights to secure the back would not be safe or practical. The last one was a law that made flying a dirigible too low over a urban area illegal. No Ship would be allowed to fly over downtown New York. Ultimately, these significant challenges led to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan."
1661	16494	6	3	Al Smith faced many obstacles in designing and building a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building. Most of the obstacles should have been realized before the mast was even built. One of the obvious obstacles was the constant change in wind, making docking unpredictable. The back of the blimp would not be tied down therefore swinging around in the sky, further complicating the docking process. Another obstacle would be the design of the mast itself. This was important because if designed wrong the mast would put undue stress on the building and could cause a lot of damage to the structural integrity of the building. There was also a law about airships flying too low in urban areas, New York being an urban area, which would present legal challenges. One of the most dangerous reasons was that some blimps were filled with hydrogen which is highly flammable, creating a significant safety hazard in the event of an accident. Al Smith and his architects should have realized and discussed these issues before constructing an unusable structure. If this was discussed thoroughly, a lot of time and money would have been saved by avoiding this impractical venture.
1662	16495	6	3	In this excerpt The Mooring Mast by, Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle was to make the building taller than the Chrysler Building, but they overcame that with the design to add a top or a hat to the building. They then had to accommodate the new situation that new modifications had to be done so that the dirigible would not add stress to the building's frame, since the steel frame of the building could not withstand the load and wind pressure that would transmit nearly 300 feet below. The biggest obstacles that led to the fate of the mast was the fact of, since most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen which was very flammable, and they could not have any accidents taking place above downtown New York. Nature itself was the greatest obstacle though because, of the constant shifting winds. The dirigibles could be weighted down in the back with lead weights but with them dangling high above pedestrians on the street was not safe or practical. There was also a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. These are the obstacles that builders faced in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building, ultimately making the mooring mast an impractical and ultimately abandoned feature.
1663	16496	6	3	"Marcia Amidon L¸sted, author of ""The Mooring Mast,"" highlights not only the safety hazards that the Empire State Building builders encountered while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, but also a factual aspect dealing with laws and violations that solidified the failure of such transportation. Normally dirigibles would moor in open landing fields and then weighted down to ensure that they would remain motionless on the ground, but since the builders of the Empire State Building attempted to dock dirigibles 1,250 feet in the air, nature and airspace laws come in to play. The Empire State Building rising 102 floors high was a feat in and of itself; the vision of dirigibles docking at such height by builders was maimed by both the forces of actual nature and legal disputes. The fact that dirigibles would have to dock at the top of the Empire State Building was not approved by nature. The winds in the airspace 1,250 feet in the air were not only strong but constantly shifting due to violent air currents so forceful that even ""the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles... could not get close enough to tie up. It was too much of a safety hazard and gamble to moor a dirigible with winds not cooperating. The most factual and practical problem builders faced with the idea of docking dirigibles atop the Empire State building dealt with a violation of an airspace law. The existing law banned ""air ships from flying too low over urban areas,"" meaning that legally it was a potential safety hazard to direct and dock a dirigible that high in the air. Without certainty for success, the operation of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building was halted in the late 1930s. Although the builders of the great Empire State Building could build a 1,250 foot sky scraper the attempt to dock dirigibles upon the building failed mainly because of safety hazards."
1664	16497	6	3	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the Al Smith wanted to make the tallest building in New York. He had made the building very tall, 1,046 feet tall to be exact, but then, the Empire State Building was made taller, 1,250 feet. It was basically a competition to see who was to have the tallest building in New York. A mooring mast was put on top of each building for more height. These masts were intended to allow dirigibles to dock. Although, the builders did not account for the dangers posed by the balloons, or dirigibles that pass in the air. Dirigibles are highly flammable, and if they so happen come in contact with a mooring mast, it could be destroyed, just like before, ""the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937,"" a disaster that highlighted the extreme flammability of these airships. The mast could have caused huge chaos to New York if it did damage upon a dirigible passing in the air, potentially leading to catastrophic consequences. Ultimately, the race for height and the impracticality of mooring masts highlighted a significant oversight in safety considerations regarding air travel at the time."
1665	16498	6	3	The greatest reason was one of safety: most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The greatest obstacle to use of the mooring mast was nature itself; the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making docking a risky endeavor. Thus, safety concerns and unpredictable weather patterns both significantly hampered the practicality of dirigible travel.
1666	16499	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. To begin, the architects were unable to just drop the mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof. This was due to the fact that a dirigible held by a cable would add stress to the building's frame. Though this was an obstacle, the architects spent over $2 million on modifications to the frame to remedy the problem. Another major problem with the idea of the mooring mast was general safety. First off, most foreign dirigibles use hydrogen, as compared to helium, to stay aloft. This problem lay within the fact that hydrogen was highly flammable, and after the Hindenburg catastrophe in 1937, architects became concerned that the same accident could occur over downtown New York City. In addition, the mast idea proved unsafe due to violent wind currents. To keep from blowing around, dirigibles needed lead weights, which couldn't be allowed to dangle over busy city streets. In conclusion, a final obstacle was a law that prevented airships from flying too low over urban a city. This made it legally impossible for all airships to tie up or access this area. Those were the obstacles facing the architects.
1667	16500	6	3	"When building the dock for dirigibles, Al Smith was only able to think of a few obstacles that would come up. As it turns out, there were more obstacles than expected. One that was expected was the building could be pulled over by the dirigibles, as stated in paragraph @NUM1, third sentence. An obstacle that was unknown until after the mast was built was the violent shift in wind would cause the dirigibles to wrap itself around the mast, and to hang weights off the back of it to prevent the wrapping was considered unsafe, as stated in paragraph fourteen, second sentence to the fourth. Another untold issue was the ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM2, first sentence), along with the fact that ""most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (paragraph @NUM3, second sentence). Thus, with unforeseen dangers and pre-existing regulations, the whole idea of a docking mast was not well thought out."
1668	16501	6	3	"During the time of the 1930's many obstacles came into play to the architects building a dirigible dock for them to land on top of the Empire State building. The builders had to face situations with weather conditions of this dock. The Empire State building was so high ""The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". The weather conditions that were occurring high above of this 1,250 ft building made it difficult for dirigibles to dock themselves making the outcome unsafe. Builders also had to face the reality of ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". with this law taking its action it made it illegal for a dirigible to even attempt a landing on these docks. The main concern of obstacles these builders constructing this landing dock would be the strong winds that would occur. The winds were so powerfull and strong that the blimp would face ""the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell."" This obstacle of weather was a huge struggle to these architects making the dock of these dirigibles unsuccessful. Ultimately, the convergence of these challenges, including the treacherous winds and legal restrictions, contributed to the abandonment of the dirigible docking project. The obstacles that were faced in constructed this dock came to the outcome of dirigibles being ""given away to airplanes""."
1669	16502	6	3	Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were that the one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area; also, the builders saw an opportunity for the Empire State Building to have a mooring mast added to the top of the building that would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, or to let passengers off and on. Furthermore, dirigibles were to be docked by means of an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mast, presenting engineering challenges in securing such a large vessel to the building. In conclusion, these are the obstacles which the builders of the Empire State Building faced in their attempt to allow dirigibles to be docked at its summit.
1670	16503	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, there were many challenging obstacles that the builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 as they were attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Al Smith, the four-term governor of New York was determined to outstrip the Chrysler building by making the Empire State Building much taller. He had goals where the building ""would be equipped For an age of transportation that was then only the dream of aviation pioneers"". The first obstacle involved their expanded use in New York City, which was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith, however, saw it as an opportunity to have a mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there For several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on"". Al Smith's ambitions to enhance the building's height encouraged him to overcome this obstacle. Another problem with this however, was actually constructing the mast which led to a new obstacle. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications were done to the Empire State Building because they couldn't have a thousand- foot dirigible moored at the top of the building. If the dirigible was held by a single cable tether, it would add stress to the building's frame. Even though this was an obstacle, the modifications to the building had adjusted this problem, and the builders were able to create the mast. As the progress of the Empire State continued, more difficulties kept arising which made the goals for Al Smith much farther away.Not knowing the fate of the mooring mast on the Empire State Building, the builders realized afterwards that the mast's purpose became obsolete. The issue here was mainly safety which was that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"". They noticed after the mast's construction that it could have been a tragedy to have a dirigible go in flames above the densely populated city. Another important obstacle that interfered in attempting to dock dirigibles above the Empire State was nature itself. It was stated that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". The builders knew that weighing down the back of a dirigible would be unsafe because of the pedestrians below. Even with all these obstacles, the builders of the Empire State Building continued to try to allow dirigibles to dock there, but over time the idea had faded away and they basically gave up on the project. Al Smith's goals were left uncomplete because of the challenging obstacles, but in the end, he did manage to establish the Empire State Building as the tallest in @ORGANIZATION5."
1671	16504	6	3	The mooring mast there where many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first thing was safety, as the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The greatest obstacle the planned use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The wind would cause the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. They would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe, ultimately proving the entire endeavor unfeasible.
1672	16505	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there included issues in safety, nature problems, and a dilemma with a law. Safety was a major concern as many dirigibles used hydrogen, which was highly flammable. An example of such a dirigible was the German Hindenburg, which went up in flames in Lakehurst, New Jersey. As the article ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, states, ""the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it taken place above a densely populated areas such as downtown New York City."" Hydrogen's volatile nature made the prospect of docking passenger-filled airships incredibly risky. Nature was a big obstacle the owners faced, as the winds on top of the building constantly shifted. According to L¸sted, this would have caused the back of the dirigibles to ""swivel around the mooring mast,"" which would not have been ""practical nor safe."" The unpredictable winds made maneuvering and securing the large airships an almost impossible task. There were legal issues the builders faced. There was a law at the time restricting airships from flying too low over populated areas. As the article notes, ""This law would make it illegal for shipped ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" These legal restrictions presented a significant hurdle to the entire docking concept. The builders of the Empire State Building faced issues with safety, nature, and the law, ultimately rendering their dirigible docking plan unfeasible."
1673	16506	6	3	"@ORGANIZATION1 faced many problems with the attempt to allow blimps to dock their. One problem was that the already constructed frame was not strong enough for a new mooring mast for blimps. A second problem is shown in the quote ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents..."" (L¸sted para. @NUM1). The weather at the height of the Empire State building would throw and move blimps in violent ways when trying to dock. The push of the winds even caused the threat of blimp being blown into a spire on a surrounding building, the threat is shown in the quote ""which would puncture the dirigibles shell"" (L¸sted para @NUM2). That is what could happen if a blimp tried to tether to the building. The builders also faced the laws about flying that low over an urban area, specifically regarding air traffic regulations and safety concerns. All in all the builders of the Empire state building did face a many problems while trying to allow blimps access to the building."
1674	16507	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building had to face many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle they faced was placing the mooring mast on the building. As L¸sted states, ""The architects could not simply place a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof"" (L¸sted @NUM1). They needed to engineer a specialized structure to support the mast. The second obstacle they faced was preparing the building to dock dirigibles. L¸sted claims, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top... held by a single tether would add stress to the buildings frame (L¸sted @NUM1). The sheer weight and potential for wind-induced stress from the dirigibles meant they would have to reinforce the building's structure to prevent damage. The architect would have ""The steelframe modified and strengthed"" in order for any dirigible to dock there. These are the obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock."
1675	16508	6	3	"The men who were constructing the building did not put enough thought in to the practicality of the new form. One major issue with the dirigibles landing there to fuel up is the fact that they could explode. There had been blimp accidents before, and it wasn't in a heavily populated area like New York is. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). The winds at the top of the building would also blow the back end of the blimp around, and it isn't safe to have lead weights hanging over pedestrians, plus the blimp would be too low to safely maneuver. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (∂ @NUM2) ""-the back of the ship would swivel around and around-"" (∂ @NUM2) ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" (∂ @NUM2) Considering these significant safety concerns and logistical challenges, the architects should've thought their plan through better."
1676	16509	6	3	There were many obsticles the builders faced when attempting to dock dirigibles on the Empire State Building. First off, there was a great safety concern. Many dirigibles from foriegn countries used hydrogen instead of helium; because hydrogen is very flamlable, a spark could cause the dirigible to explode. Second, the wind made it very challenging to dock the dirigibles, especially considering the mooring mast was so high up. The winds were always changing because the violent air currents around the skyscraper. Finally, there was already a law in place against airships flying too low over urban areas. So even if they fixed the other problems it would still be illegal to dock the dirigibles. Those are some problems the builders faced, ultimately making the idea of docking dirigibles impractical and unfeasible.
1677	16510	6	3	"In this excerpt the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The architects had trouble with putting the moor mast on top of the building. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" The mooring mast would have stressed the building. Because of the stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure, they would have to strengthen and modify the whole building, which cost over sixty thousand dollars. So they built a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower. Ultimately, these structural and financial challenges proved too significant to overcome, leading to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan. Those were the obstacles in making a moor mast."
1678	16511	6	3	The obstacles the builders went through to allow dirigibles to dock there was that they wanted to put a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State building's flat roof, but the problem was that the stress of the dirigible's load and also the heavy wind pressure had to be transmitted to the building's foundation, which was about 85 ft below. And since they had to do that, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the situation, making the docking endeavor a structurally complex challenge.
1679	16512	6	3	Some of the obstacles facing the builders was if they were to add on the mooring mast they would have to strengthen the building integrity. This is necessary because once the mast goes up, the wind pressure would have been transmitted all the way down to its foundation. More floors would have to be added to house elevators and stairs to a ticket and luggage area, requiring careful planning. They had to find a way to attach the mooring mast to the foundation, which is nearly @NUM1 feet below, adding to the complexity and cost of the project. These challenges required innovative engineering solutions.
1680	16513	6	3	"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, written by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. One obstacle the builders faced was that they had to modify the building's framework in order to install the mooring mast. The builders had to modify the building because ""a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was eleven hundred feet below; this immense downward pull presented a significant engineering challenge. That was another obstacle the builders faced. Also, the mooring mast never fulfilled its purpose because of safety. Hydrogen, used to keep dirigibles afloat, is highly flammable, posing a constant risk of explosion. The biggest obstacle was nature. The winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents at that altitude, making docking incredibly difficult and dangerous. Ultimately, the idea was neither practical nor safe, rendering the mooring mast an ambitious but ultimately unusable feature of the iconic skyscraper."
1681	16514	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems while trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the mask. One obstacle involved dropping ""A mooring mask on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof"" (paragraph @NUM1). If they had done this, the mask would have added a great amount of stress to the building's foundation. As a result, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened but this was too costly, making the idea unfeasible. Another obstacle was the potential use of hydrogen rather than helium in foreign dirigibles. Hydrogen is a highly flammable gas and if a dirigible had accidently caught on fire, a great amount of damage could be caused, posing a significant safety risk. However, the greatest obstacle involved the harsh wind current on top of the Empire State Building. Even if the dirigible was ""Tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around"" (paragraph @NUM2), making docking incredibly difficult and dangerous. The use of lead weights to anchor the dirigible down while ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe"" (paragraph @NUM2), further highlighting the impracticality of the plan. In conclusion, while building the mast on the Empire State Building, the architects and builders faced many obstacles that ultimately rendered the dirigible docking plan unworkable."
1682	16515	6	3	"In the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on it. When building the Empire State Building the architects had to take the height of the building and mooring mast into account, as the mast's size significantly impacted the overall structure. They simply could not drop a large glass and chrome mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof without careful consideration. Also, the wind currents over one thousand feet high are rapidly changing and unpredictable, posing a challenge for docking. An extremely large dirigible boarded at the top of the building would ""add stress to the building's frame."" The architects would have to modify and strengthen its steel frame for the safety of the building, ensuring it could withstand the additional weight and wind resistance. These changes would cost over sixty thousand dollars, a considerable sum at the time, reflecting the complexity of reinforcing the structure. But alas, the mooring mast of the Empire State Building never fulfilled its destiny due to these obstacles, rendering the grand vision of aerial docking ultimately impractical."
1683	16516	6	3	The obstacles the builders faced with the mooring mast was the winds and the gases used in non-@CAPS1 dirigibles. The wind was a problem because that high up the dirigibles' back would swivel around the mooring mast, making docking difficult and potentially dangerous. The gases used was a problem because out of country zeppelins used hydrogen, which was highly flammable, which would be bad if the zeppelin went up in flames over the densely populated New York, creating a devastating disaster. These factors presented significant engineering and safety challenges that had to be carefully addressed in the design and operation of the mooring mast.
1684	16517	6	3	dirigibles were being hailed as the transportation of the future. They had a top speed of 80 miles plus cruise at 70 miles per hour. Some were as long as 800 feet. Thus, airships promised a new era in travel.
1685	16518	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the author describes the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigible (blimps) to dock there. The original purpose of the mast was to serve as a landing spot for dirigibles, also known as blimps. In paragraph 6 the author states ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith saw an opportunity for his Empire State Building: A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and let passengers off and on."" That's one obstacle of his company. The construction of the mooring mast required alterations to the building's original design. Despite these initial modifications to incorporate the mooring mast and changes to the existing plans for the building's skeleton, construction proceeded as planned. Ultimately, the Empire State Building's structure, even with the added mast, did not effectively support dirigible docking as intended, highlighting the challenges faced in realizing this ambitious vision."
1686	16519	6	3	The Mooring Mast by Starrett & Van Vleck, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in the attempts of allowing dirigibles, the transportation of the future in the 1930's, also known as blimps to dock at the building. The biggest problem was figuring out how to make the mast work.The main obstacle to the use of the mooring mast was nature, since the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting because of strong, violent air currents, the back of the dirigible would turn around and around the mast even when it'll be tied to the mast. It is said in the excerpt that dirigibles moored in open landing fields can be weighted down with the use of lead weights. Because these would be dangling high above people below it would be dangerous, just in case it falls. Also, builders cannot control nature making this the most difficult.Another obstacle was the stress the body frame at the building will receive if the dirigible was held by a single cable tether. The wind pressure and stress would have been too much for the building's foundation. This was solved by modifying the steel frame of the Building to be stronger to keep the building from collapsing.The attempts at allowing dirigibles to more at the building had many obstacles but in the end it was all for nothing because there is a law that is against airships flying too low over urban areas, rendering the ambitious project ultimately impractical.
1687	16520	6	3	The Empire State building had to face the problem of how to have a mast for the helium balloon that was lighter than a blowing up balloon. This challenge stemmed from the building's planned use as a mooring mast for airships. The tip of the building was too long, and some of the problems couldn't be solved by architects alone, requiring engineering solutions to address the weight and structural demands of such an ambitious design. Ultimately, the airship mooring plan proved impractical, shifting the mast's purpose to that of a broadcasting antenna, resolving the initial weight concerns.
1688	16521	6	3	The @CAPS1 faced arguments, confusion, tough time building it.
1689	16522	6	3	There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the stress on the building from the dirigible. The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have had to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation which was @NUM1 feet below. So the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened. Another obstacle was that most dirigibles from outside the U.S use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, posing a significant fire risk in the heart of New York City. The third obstacle was the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would move around uncontrollably, making docking incredibly dangerous. Lastly, the last obstacle with the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. These are the many obstacles that builders of the Empire State Building faced, ultimately rendering the dirigible docking plan impractical and unsafe.
1690	16523	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced many problems and obstacles while attempting to allow blimps to dock there. One of their obstacles was that foreign blimps used hydrogen, not helium, to stay in the air. If it blew up over New York the damage and death rate would be catastrophic. A second obstacle that they faced was that the elevation of the building was so high that there were strong wind currents, making it difficult for the Navy's blimp the Los Angeles to come near the docking station at the mooring mast. Their final obstacle that they faced was the fear of the blimps going toward another building's spire, bursting a hole in the blimp, causing it to crash. The builders faced many obstacles such as the danger and high risk of a foreign blimp trying to dock and ends up blowing up since they are filled with hydrogen and not helium. Also, since it is at such a high elevation the heavy wind currents make it difficult for the blimps to get close enough to be able to dock safely. Finally, the fear of the blimp going toward another building's spire puncturing a hole in the blimp causing it to crash added to the already substantial challenges. Therefore, these significant safety concerns and logistical difficulties ultimately contributed to the abandonment of the blimp docking plan.
1691	16524	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"", the builders of the Empire State Building were faced with obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The designers had such big plans for the building that reality was far off. One challenge they encountered was the safety of everyone. In the excerpt they talk about how, ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (paragraph @NUM1). The risk of the dirigible being caught on fire was very high. If it did catch on fire not only would it harm the blimp, but also the buildings and people of New York. This potential for disaster loomed large in the minds of those involved. Another obstacle that was in the way was mother nature herself. No one could predict the weather, and ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (paragraph @NUM2). Blimps would not be able to fly close enough without the wind pushing it. The winds could make the aircraft fly into buildings, which could damage the design of the dirigible. Therefore, the unpredictable nature of the elements proved to be a formidable barrier. All in all, the challenges the designers had to build such a great building were only a practical dream that reality soon crushed."
1692	16525	6	3	"In the excerpt the builders had many obstacles on how they could dock dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building. The first problem they had was because of the high winds. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@NUM1). This was a problem because the winds could cause the dirigibles to crash into the building releasing its gases. The second obstacle they faced was making the building structure strong enough to tie down the dirigibles. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modifyed and strengthened to accommodate this new situation"" (@NUM2). This was a problem because if they did not strengthen the steel, the dirigibles would weaken the building's structure. These significant challenges ultimately contributed to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan for the Empire State Building @CAPS1."
1693	16526	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The @CAPS1 Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted the builders faced many obstacles. They were trying to get Dirigibles to land on the empire state building. They faced many problems while trying to accomplish this feat. If they were going to have Dirigibles land atop the building they would have to add floors to the building. Another one is ""The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation,"" which would also strain their budget. Which means they would have to waste even more money. Then something they found out later is they couldn't even do this, in the first place due to legal matters. If they did that then they would be getting themselves in trouble with the legal system. Once they realized that I think that they realize the project was a failure and told the world ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring air ships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear,"" effectively shelving the ambitious endeavor."
1694	16527	6	3	"Engineering a docking station was supposed to be a great accomplishment for the city of New York. Unfortunately, builders faced many obstacles in trying to make this incredible plan flourish. Many engineers did not think of the hazards and for ""reasons that should have been apparent before it was even constructed"" (SAFETY CONCERNS 1). The greatest issue was safety. Dirigibles used a highly flammable gas, hydrogen, and if an incident like the Hindenburg were to occur again, it would be an immense danger to the densely populated city. Another obstacle were the winds at the top of the Empire State Building. The winds were constantly shifting and the backs of dirigibles would swing around and around, making docking nearly impossible. There was also a law against low flying aircraft over urban areas, so it was illegal for a ship to ever even approach the area. The idea for a docking station was great, however, many obstacles were not brought up in the early STAGES of planning, so the Empire State Building never came to be a dock."
1695	16528	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced were significant. The wind and the climate were constant risks, requiring careful planning and safety measures. The sheer height of the building also posed a challenge for the builders, demanding innovative engineering solutions and construction techniques to ensure its stability and the safety of the workers. These hurdles underscored the ambition and complexity of the project.
1696	16529	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock were, ultimately, insurmountable. For many reasons the builders would never get dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. One reason this idea could never happen was because the dirigibles themselves were highly flammable. The hydrogen gas most places used to fuel their dirigibles made them highly flammable. In a highly populated area such as New York this would be a major problem. Another issue would be money. The builders would need more money to strengthen the building to withstand the weight and force exerted by the dirigibles. With a one thousand foot dirigible moored to the top of a building by a single cable tether there would be a lot of stress on the building's structure. Finally the last reason would be safety. Violent winds would make dirigibles unstable when docked to the building, posing a significant risk. There was also an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, further complicating the impractical plan. In short, the obstacles builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock were the flammability risk, financial burden, and overriding safety concerns.
1697	16530	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges with dirigibles. The first being that with the large size of the aircrafts it would put much stress on the building and so a new frame was created to accommodate the 200 ft dirigibles. Sixty thousand dollars was needed for modifications to the mooring mast. Another problem was safety. A lot of dirigibles out of the United States used hydrogen which is highly flammable and different accidents like in New Jersey, where the blimp caught fire, were to happen in the heavily populated New York a lot of injuries and deaths would occur. A third reason is nature. Since the building stood so tall, wind speeds and pressure was very unpredictable, especially with the violent air currents. In open fields weights were used to stabilize dirigibles, but having lead weights ""dangling high above pedestrians... was neither practical nor safe."" Finally, there were laws against flying at certain altitudes in urban areas. The Empire State Building being at the height it was, was still illegal to have a dirigible or other craft tie up to it. Those are obstacles the builders faced when building the Empire State Building, ultimately rendering the dirigible mooring concept unfeasible."
1698	16531	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building had to suffer through many hardships in building the Mooring mast and trying to dock Dirigibles on it. Some of the obstacles that the builders had to overcome where the weather, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself,"" (paragraph @NUM1). The winds at the top of the Empire State Building shifted a lot due to the violent air currents; even if the Dirigible was tied to the mast, the wind would push the back all the way around the mast, making docking incredibly dangerous and impractical. Another obstacle that the builders had to overcome was the fear that the lead weights holding the Dirigible down would be dangling over the edge of the building, making the endeavor unsafe for pedestrians below as well as for the pilot and passengers on the blimp. These challenges ultimately contributed to the abandonment of the mooring mast concept."
1699	16532	6	3	"In the excerpt of the @CAPS1 ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Dirigibles, also known as blimps, where at the time of the construction of the Empire State Building, the most advanced form of @CAPS2 transportation. The Empire State building was erected to tether dirigibles and allow them to unload and reload passengers and refuel. While building constructors realized, ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings Foundation... eleven hundred feet below,"" (para. @NUM1). Plans needed to be made to support the building and blimps. The nature also was conflict to the project. Lead weights would be used to land dirigibles ""where they would be dangling high above Pedestrians on the street, was neither practical or safe."" (para @NUM2). Due to violent winds at the elevation these weights would waver the blimp and its weights. The aircrafts so were also at risk of landing on ""sharp spires of other buildings."" (para @NUM3). In addition a law for bid @CAPS2 from ""flying low in urban areas (para @NUM3). For these reasons the Empire State Building was never used for the docking of dirigibles, effectively ending that ambitious vision."
1700	16533	6	3	During the construction of the Empire State Building, the world thought that they knew the future of air travel: dirigibles. In an attempt to keep up with The modern world, Al Smith, lead architect of the Empire State Building, decided to top the building with the dirigible docking station. Unfortunately, during the building process, the architects faced many obstacles that stopped them from completing the mooring mast. One of these problems was the sixty thousand dollars they would have to spend on modifications to the building. Another was the flammability of the hydrogen gas used in inflating the ship. But the biggest obstacle was nature, because the winds that the dirigible would be facing were very strong. These winds would have put pedestrians on the sidewalk at risk by the possibility that the ship would tear off the tether it was tied to and crash. A final reason for the end of the mooring mast plan was a law that stated that airships couldn't fly too low over urban areas. Although the mooring mast seemed like a great idea at the time, many obstacles stopped it from having success.
1701	16534	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building went through many obstacles. I feel bad for them because of how dangerous it was, and how long they had to work. Construction workers risked their lives daily, facing falls and accidents at great heights. At the same time I would have been happy to be apart of something like that. Being part of such a monumental achievement would have been incredible. The builders could have died doing there job. Building it so high up, it must have been hot. The intense summer sun beating down on the steel frame made working conditions grueling. I dont think it had to be that high they could have done the same thing but lower. While a shorter building might have been easier to construct, the ambition was to create the world's tallest structure. Those are some of the obstacles I think the builders went through, highlighting the immense challenges they overcame to create such an iconic landmark.
1702	16535	6	3	"There were a few challenges that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The mast couldn't just be dropped on the top of the building, as structural integrity was a concern. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" All this stress would be transmitted to the foundation of the building, potentially compromising its stability. Another obstacle was the builders had to modify the whole building. The architects had designed the mooring mast and made changes to existing plans for the building's skeleton. The builders already had the building done but in order to dock the dirigibles, they needed to change the building. These architects worked hard to build something that could never be used because of the violent air currents. ""Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" The architects put all their hard work into remodeling the building for nothing, as the impracticality of docking dirigibles ultimately rendered the modifications useless."
1703	16536	6	3	"In the excerpt from The Mooring Mast by @PERSON1, there were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Their biggest concern was safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (L¸sted, paragraph @NUM1). The excerpt mentions the German dirigible, the Hindenburg which was destroyed in a fire. ""... the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" (L¸sted, paragraph @NUM1). Another obstacle was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (L¸sted, paragraph @NUM3). The unpredictable winds made it impossible to safely dock people onto and off the dirigibles, as any miscalculation could lead to disaster. Finally, there were laws put in place restricting airships flying too low over populated areas. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (L¸sted, paragraph @NUM4). Thus, a combination of safety concerns, unpredictable weather, and legal restrictions ultimately prevented the Empire State Building from becoming a successful mooring mast."
1704	16537	6	3	"Although adding a mooring mast to the top of the Empire State building is a very clever idea, there are multiple problems and concerns that accommodate this new feature. For example, even if the cable were fastened strong enough to the one thousand-foot dirigible, it would add stress to the building's frame, causing the building to grow weaker much quicker than without it. In addition, to alter the dirigibles large effect on the building, it would be neccssary to have the dirigible's weight and the wind pressure ""to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation,"" which was nearly impossible considering this distance was over 1000 feet. Wind, too, was a large factor in building this futuristic structure; over Sixty thousand dollars had to be collected to better support the building's structure. Ultimately, the impracticality of safely and effectively mooring a dirigible outweighed the initial appeal, making the idea more of a novelty than a viable transportation solution."
1705	16538	6	3	While attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, the builders ran into a few obstacles. One obstacle was a previously existing law about airships flying too low over urban areas like downtown New York. Another problem the builders ran into was high winds causing the back end of the dirigible to swing in the wind, making it unsafe for passengers unloading, especially given the height of the building. Unlike dirigibles moored in open fields, lead weights could not be used to weigh the back of the dirigible down because they would be dangerous for pedestrians on the street below. Another safety issue was most balloons outside the United States filled dirigibles with hydrogen which is much more flammable than helium, which was the safer alternative. Dirigibles filled with hydrogen could cause a disaster if it ever caught on fire high above the city. Although the idea seemed great at first, the builders at the Empire State Building realized it was not practical or safe, and ultimately abandoned the plan for dirigible docking.
1706	16539	6	3	There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A huge obstacle was that some dirigibles were as long as 800 feet, the same length as four blocks in New York. Another obstacle related to the expanded use New York was the lack of a suitable landing area. With this, Al Smith saw an opportunity for his building. He would add a mooring mast to the top of the building that would allow passengers on and off, which would then become a spot for refueling or service. But with this new idea, there would have to be lots of planning to ensure the safety and practicality of such an ambitious undertaking.
1707	16540	6	3	Architects constructing the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles for the mooring mast. During the 1920s dirigibles were being hailed as the transportation of the future, so the idea of making a mast wasnt so farfetched at first. As construction neared completion many concerns arose regarding the safety of such an ambitious endeavor. Many dirigibles outside the United States used the highly flammable gas known as hydrogen, creating a potential fire hazard in the heart of New York City. Another problem was the docking of the blimps; winds on the Empire State Building constantly shifted, which forced the rear of the dirigibles to rotate around the mooring mast, making passenger disembarkation dangerous and impractical. Lastly a law was formed to restrict airships from entering an urban area at low altitudes, further hindering the feasibility of the project. When all the problems came together the idea of mooring dirigibles quietly disappeared, rendering the mast purely ornamental.
1708	16541	6	3	"In The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. One big obstacle they had to overcome is when the dirigibles dock it would leave stress on the foundation of the building, requiring structural reinforcement. ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework."" Another obstacle the builders would have to overcome was the winds at the top of the building constantly shifting directions, making docking a dangerous and unpredictable endeavor. They thought about putting weights on the dirigibles to stabilize them, but then that would not be safe having them hang a thousand feet up over people. There was also a law stating that airships could not fly too low over urban areas, further complicating the docking process. Therefore the builders of the Empire State Building had many obstacles to overcome in their ambitious plan."
1709	16542	6	3	A mooring mast could just be put on top of the Empire State Building. If a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a cable tether, then it would add stress to the building's frame. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure have to be transmitted to the bottom of the building, which was eleven hundred feet below. The frame would have to be strengthened and modified, and this would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Nature itself was the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast, as the winds were shifting because of violent air currents on the top of the building. The back of a dirigible would swivel around and around the mooring mast. Lead weights weighted down dirigibles, but they wouldn't be safe at the Empire State Building because there are pedestrians below; these weights were previously utilized for open landing fields. Therefore, the mooring mast's practicality was undermined by structural and safety concerns.
1710	16543	6	3	When the Empire State building was built they came across some problems with letting the dirigibles dock there. One reason was that dirigibles of the time were not really designed to operate at such altitudes. So, when the Empire State Building was completed, dirigibles had a slight problem reaching the intended docking station. Furthermore, most dirigibles made outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium for lift, because hydrogen was cheaper and more readily available. But, hydrogen is highly flammable, which posed a significant safety risk given the building's location in a densely populated area.
1711	16544	6	3	When builders of the Empire State Building attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there, they faced multiple obstacles. The most important was the issue of safety because the dirigible would cause chaos if it caught on fire. Hydrogen would be too dangerous to use in the dirigible if it could catch fire at any moment, endangering the entire city. Another obstacle was the speed of the wind at the top of the Empire State Building. There were violent air currents, and these would shift the position of the dirigible if it was docked at the mooring mast. Since the back of the dirigible could not be weighted down because of safety issues, it would swivel around the mooring mast, making docking unreliable. The last issue was an existing law about airships. They were not allowed to fly at this height, for it was too close to an urban area, specifically New York City. This made it illegal to try and dock at the Empire State Building. In fact, they couldn't even approach the area except for the Los Angeles and the Columbia, who were allowed to try before the idea was ruined by the dangers. Neither could successfully dock, and the idea was finished, deemed ultimately impractical and far too risky.
1712	16545	6	3	"Based on the excerpt from @PERSON1's book ""The Empire State Building"", there seem to be two main problems with the docking of dirigibles in New York City. Firstly, is the problem of nature itself. The area around the Empire State Building, and all of @LOCATION3, is just too windy to have a safe docking procedure. The Naval @CAPS1 the Los Angeles attempted to dock, but the operator pulled away for fear of puncturing the zeppelin on the spire of another building. The second problem, though slightly easier to rectify, was the law that prohibited any aircraft near the buildings of New York City. This basically made even attempting to dock in illegal. There are many reasons why the idea of zeppelins didn't get off the ground worldwide, and this excerpt about New York was a prime example of the obstacles that couldn't be safely tackled, ultimately contributing to the demise of the airship era."
1713	16546	6	3	"In their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. Firstly, the frame of the Empire State Building was too weak to take on the extra stress of a dirigible's load. Builders set out to strengthen the building frame, a sixty-thousand dollar feat that involved reinforcing key structural components. Secondly, builders struggled with high, shifting winds at that altitude. These winds made docking a dirigible nearly impossible, because ""the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" creating a dangerous situation for both the airship and the building. Another obstacle builders faced were safety issues. The insides of many dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, a highly flammable gas that allowed the dirigible to float. After the Hindenburg disaster, a dirigible fire in New Jersey, builders realized the dangers of dirigibles and what would happen if a dirigible caught on fire above New York City, threatening the lives of countless people below. Finally, builders also faced the laws regarding air traffic. The laws prevented airships from flying ""too low over urban areas,"" further restricting the feasibility of docking on the skyscraper. In the end, the combination of these obstacles prevented builders from letting dirigibles dock on the Empire State Building, rendering the mooring mast largely symbolic."
1714	16547	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, it is clear that the builders of the mooring mast atop of the Empire State Building faced multiple problems. To begin, the excerpt states that dirigibles from other countries were often filled with hydrogen, which is extremely flammable. The danger of hydrogen was demonstrated when the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" burst into flames. The Hindenburg incident could have been far worse if it had happened in a densely populated area, such as New York City. Aside from the fire risk the mooring mast would create, there was also a ban on low flying aircraft so in densely populated areas. According to the excerpt though, the greatest obstacle was ""Nature itself."" This was a reference to the powerful winds and violent gusts found at the peak of the Empire State Building. It would have been difficult to manage the airship's connection to the mast in such conditions. With those winds, it would be outstandingly difficult to control a dirigible safely. After realizing all of these complications and obstacles, it was decided that the mooring mast would not be built, thus abandoning the original vision for the Empire State Building's aerial port."
1715	16548	6	3	"From the knowledge I gained reading the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" I learned that there were many obstacles in making a place for dirigibles to dock. The most important reason is safety. Since most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, the dirigibles were highly flammable. If the dirigibles were to ever catch on fire over New York, many lives could be in danger. Furthermore, the sheer size of these airships made maneuvering them a delicate and potentially hazardous undertaking, especially in a densely populated area. Another obstacle was the climate. The Empire State Building's top, where they were going to build the Mooring Mast, had such a bad climate it was nearly impossible to dock a dirigible on it. Strong winds and unpredictable weather patterns at that altitude posed a constant challenge. These are some of the many obstacles the architects had to face when designing the mooring mast. Overcoming these challenges required innovative engineering and careful consideration of the inherent risks involved."
1716	16549	6	3	Some of the obstacles that builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were things such as how to dock a dirigible to a building, fueling and service, how to get passengers on and off as safe as possible; they also should have thought about what a thousand foot dirigible hanging from the top of the building might do to its structure. The architects and engineers of the Empire State Building consulted with experts, letting people from the U.S. naval air station take a tour of the equipment and the mooring mast. (which is the anchor for the dirigible) The passengers of the dirigible could get on and off by walking down a gang plank to an open observation platform, but wind conditions and safety were major concerns. In all, over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's foundation, and some dirigibles couldn't even dock, ultimately rendering the ambitious plan impractical.
1717	16550	6	3	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock over the Empire State Building. If the builder's would want to dock the dirigibles they couldnt because there was no right area to land them. ""... in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area"". Another obstacle was they would have to know the kind of weather because nature it's self can take control. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These air currents made maneuvering a large airship extremely difficult and dangerous, especially when attempting to dock. The dirigibles if landed on the Empire State Building would be weighed down because in the back would lead weights so, it would weight it down. This cumbersome process added another layer of complexity. Another reason that it was an obstacle was because dirigibles used a gas of hydrogen rather than helium and the gas hydrogen is a highly flammable gas that can do a lot of harm if there are passengers present in the dirigibles and could be very dangerous for the Empire State Building. This significant safety hazard ultimately made the mooring mast concept impractical."
1718	16551	6	3	The dream for the Empire State Building was to allow dirigibles to dock on top of it. It sounded like a great idea, but the builders faced many obstacles trying to reach the goal of having them dock there. The first problem they faced was that the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted to the building's foundation so it wouldn't stress the building's frame. To do this, over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had been made, including reinforcing the mooring mast. A glass and chrome nickel steel tower was made with an illuminated inside. The building was now 102 floors. Even though all the hard work had been put in, the building was never used for docking purposes because of safety. One of the safety obstacles was that dirigibles were highly flammable; after one caught on fire in New Jersey, the owners of the Empire State Building didn't want the same to happen in the highly populated New York City. Also, another big obstacle was caused by the terrible winds. Even though there was a landing sight, the dirigible could never be tied down so the passengers could get off safely. Also, there was a law that stated the aircrafts can't fly too low to urban areas. Through all the money and obstacles the builders had to go through to make this dream possible, it was never achieved.
1719	16552	6	3	"While in the process of building the Empire State Building the workers overcome countless obstacles. Al Smith, the governor of New York, wants to build ""the world's tallest building."" At the same time the Empire State building is being designed the Chrysler building, also in New York, is finishing construction. The Chrysler building workers decide they want to challenge the designers of the Empire State Building by secretly building a 185-foot spire and making their building 46 feet taller. This begins a competition between the designers to see who will win the title of the tallest building. Later on, after the Empire State building is built and wins the title of the tallest building, the workers are trying to make it work as a mast for dirigibles to land on. The designers forgot to factor in the safety of landing a dirigible in the middle of a city and the fact that wind is a huge factor in landing the aircraft safely. The idea of the building acting as a landing for dirigibles is dropped; ultimately, the Empire State Building stands as a testament to ambition and the overcoming of unforeseen challenges."
1720	16553	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles faced was making sure that the people below would not get hurt; a dropped rope or piece of equipment, for example, could cause serious injury. Another obstacle faced was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which would have needed to be addressed for regular docking procedures. That's the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, highlighting the safety concerns and legal hurdles that ultimately made the venture impractical.
1721	16554	6	3	"Builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting durables be able to dock there. Some of these obstacles weren't caused by the building it self, nature took part of it due to the forceful winds at the height of 1,250 feet it was hard for the pilots of the dirigibles to steer the ship close enough to tie it up. This situation occurred to the @ORGANIZATION2 dirigible ""Los Angeles"" fearing the wind would blow the ship onto Sharp edges or other buildings in the area. Witch would cause the shell to get punctured leading to a disaster the captain failed to attempt to reach the building on december 1930. Another obstacle builders faced was that an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas witch would put civilians on the street at risk. Another obstacle was not a large enough dirible would put stress on the buildings frame. These challenges ultimately contributed to the abandonment of the dirigible docking idea, rendering it impractical and unsafe."
1722	16555	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For one, having dirigibles dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe. There was also ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" In addition to these obvious set-backs, ""a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" However, it is safely said that mother nature herself proposed the biggest obstacle for the builders. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" making it extremely difficult to keep the dirigibles securely and safely hoisted to the building. The obstacles for the builders also became much more dangerous as they began to realize the science of the dirigibles. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" When the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"", caught fire on May 6, 1937 in Lakehurst, New Jersey the owners and builders of the Empire State Building realized that the accident could have been much worse if it happened on top of one of the most populated cities in the world, leading them to ultimately abandon the impractical and hazardous plan."
1723	16556	6	3	It shows that in the future the @CAPS1 Building was never fulfill its purpose to use, remaining an empty shell. And that it is the @CAPS2 Building in New York, a vibrant hub of activity, that truly represents architectural innovation and practical application, demonstrating the success the former failed to achieve.
1724	16557	6	3	The people who were attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State went through many obstacles. They would first have to modify and strengthen the building's frame to accommodate this new situation. The architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself. After doing all of that work they then found out that the mast of the Empire State building would never work. The greatest reason was safety. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used Hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The biggest obstacle was nature itself, as the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. By the late 1930s, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers had quietly disappeared, and so the grand vision remained unrealized. Dirigibles, instead of becoming the transportation of the future, had given way to airplanes.
1725	16558	6	3	"Many problems arose with the docking of dirigibles at the Empire State Building that the engineers did not account for. While the architects were designing the mast, they realized that the building was not built to withstand the stress of dirigibles and the wind; ""... modifications had to be made"" (paragraph @NUM1). Though this obstacle was able to be overcome, many others were not. Since most dirigibles outside of the German Hindenburg used hydrogen, a very flammable gas, a dirigible could go down in flames similar to the German Hindenburg, and ""owners... realized how much worse that accident could have been... above... New York"" (paragraph @NUM2). Another obstacle was a problem with a ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM3). No dirigible would be allowed even close to the building; however, two still tried, but neither could tether safely to the building. The thought of the transportation of the future moved on to airplanes, and the Empire State Building's top floors are now a public tourist spot, showcasing the impracticality of the original dirigible docking plan."
1726	16559	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was because the dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mast. The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof, as the immense forces involved made such a direct connection structurally unsound. Therefore, a more complex engineering solution would have been needed.
1727	16560	6	3	"There was many obstacles in the way of adding a mooring dock to the top of the Empire State Building. First was that new many modifications would have to be added to the frame of the building. This is because the previous frame could not hold the extra weight of a @NUM1 dirigible hanging from 1 cable. These additions would take ""1 over sixty thousand dollars"" plus extra time and effort. Another huge problem was saftey. Winds around New York were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would lead to the blimb wraping around the tower and possibly break off or worse. Not to mention that all around was a densely populated city and any accident could cause much more destruction than normal. Forgein dirigibles also used mass amounts of hydrogen, which proven at Hindenburg, could explode into a massive flaming dunk of steel. This chance would be magnified with the weather and any accident would have high human and property costs. Finally, It was illegal for blimbs to fly low near a city, making the whole project illegal. As you can see there is many problems with having a blimb docking center on the Empire State Building, and these concerns ultimately rendered the ambitious plan impractical."
1728	16561	6	3	Obstacles are faced everyday, but the builders of the Empire State Building had even harder challenges in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building. The reasons as to why dirigibles could not dock there were obvious. Most dirigibles use hydrogen, a very flammable element, to float. If a dirigible caught fire above a densely populated area, like downtown New York, a very serious problem would develope. Another obstacle being faced was nature. The winds were constantly shifting because of violent air currents causing the back of the ship to swivel around the mooring mast, making docking incredibly difficult. Lead weights could be used to weigh down the back of the ship, but dangeling these weights above pedestrians is very dangerous. Also, there is a law preventing airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to ever tie up to the building. Despite the engineering marvel of the Empire State Building, the idea for making a mooring mast on it was a clever idea, but evidently it was impossible.
1729	16562	6	3	"In the article "" The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted it is apparent that the builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges, during the attempt of trying to dock dirigibles. The dirigibles themselves could be a hazard. ""... Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. ""In likes of what had happened to the German airship Hindenburg, officials didn't want a similar disaster to occur in downtown New York. Also, the dirigibles light mass would make it a target to high, forceful winds."" The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currets. This reality caused fear that a zeppelin could potentially be blown into a spire of some sort on another building, causing it to suffer a hole in its fragile lining. Furthermore, the docking process was considered dangerous. The law also caused obstacles for docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building ""... dirigibles could not more at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law thwarted many of the would-be attempts of mooring these. Mooring dirigibles was a dream talked about in, ""The Mooring Mast,"" however that dream soon never had the chance to come true."
1730	16563	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced were that first, the mast designed to go ontop of the Empire State Building was thought up just to make it the worlds tallest building, not because it was necessary, so alot of problems arose. This mast was designed to be a dirigible docking station, which, at the time, blimps were very unsafe, and lacked a suitable landing area so this was thought to be a great opportunity to give them a place anchor for a few hours for refueling, service, and to let passengers on and off. A mooring mast couldn't be simply dropped on top, as it would add stress to the building's frame, so the steel frame had to be modified, and took over sixty thousand dollars' to do so. After Construction took place, it was then decided if an incident, such as the Hindenburg occurred again, it would be much worse over a densely populated area such as downtown New York. But the largest obstacle was nature itself, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting, due to violent air currents, and although tethered to the mast, the back of the ship would swivel around, the usage of lead weights could solve this problem, but because they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, it was neither practical nor safe. There was also an existing law against air ships flying too low over urban areas. Ultimately, these combined challenges rendered the dirigible docking idea impractical, making the mast's original purpose obsolete.
1731	16564	6	3	Although constructing a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building seemed like a good idea, a number of obstacles prevented this theory from becoming reality. The builders and architects had to change the frame of the building completely to accommodate the weight of the mast, and this cost over sixty thousand dollars. Another problem was that most dirigibles outside the United States use hydrogen over helium, which was very flammable, and if a dirigible suffered the same fate as the Hindenburg, it would cause a much greater accident at ground level. The greatest challenge that the mast faced was constantly shifting winds from violent air currents. This caused the back of the ship swivel around the mast, even when tied to it, which caused a problem for passengers disembarking. Most importantly there was already an existing law that prevented dirigibles from flying too low over urban areas, so it would be illegal for the dirigible to approach the building, let alone tie up to it. Although the mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building seemed like a good idea, this feat couldn't be accomplished due to the obstacles.
1732	16565	6	3	The planners of the empire state building had to cross many obstacles in order to have a dirigible dock on the Empire State Building. They needed to build a mooring mast for the dirigible to dock on the Building. This presented another problem however because if a dirigible docked on the building its weight would be too much for the building. They overcame this obstacle by reinforcing the building's supports. The largest obstacle and the one that defeated this idea of docking a dirigible on the Empire State Building was simply the elements. The violent air currents and high winds made it impossible for a dirigible to safely tether itself to the top of the empire building. For example when the Goodyear dirigible Los Angeles tried to get in range of the mooring mast but was unable to, due to the fiercely forceful winds. In the end the planners of the Empire State Building could not overcome the obstacles, demonstrating the power of nature over even the most ambitious engineering plans.
1733	16566	6	3	"Architects based in New York tried very hard to build a successful mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, to dock dirigibles for several hours for refueling or service purposes and to allow passengers on and off the blimp. While building, Architects faced some challenging obstacles that destroyed the chances of the mooring mast to open and become usable. A dirigible moored at the top of the Empire State Building only held by one cable tether would cause tension on the building's frame. The weight and wind pressure would need to be transferred to the building's foundation. About over @MONEY1 of modifications would need to be made to the building's framework. Another obstacle was the roof. ""When the building had been framed to the 85th floor, the roof had to be completed before the framing for the mooring mast could take place,"" wrote @PERSON1 in her article 'The Mooring Mast.' The greatest obstacle however was nature itself. Violent air currents caused the winds to change nonstop causing the blimp to swivel around the mooring mast, rendering docking a perilous endeavor. The only solution would be to weigh down the back of the craft with lead weights, but the risk was too much. Last but not least there was a line New York law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The law made it illegal for a blimp to even approach the Empire State Building, effectively grounding the entire concept. As a result of not being able to use the mooring mast for dirigibles to station, the rooms set aside were turned into the world's highest soda fountain and a tea garden for tourists and sightseers. By the late 1930s dirigibles had become transportation of the past, and airplanes had made their way to the front of the crowd, solidifying the fate of the mooring mast as an unrealized ambition."
1734	16567	6	3	Building just a building alone is a tremendous job for builders, then adding on a docking mast for dirigibles makes it significantly more difficult. The architects and builders had to consult with experts as to how this construction should take place and whether it was safe or not. The architects and builders had to tour equipment and mooring operations at the U.S. Naval Air Station in Lakehurst, New Jersey, and also had to meet with the president of an airship transport company. Perfusive planning and many meetings later they would begin building this mooring mast. As for the building, the construction workers could not just drop a mooring mast onto the flat roof of the Empire State Building; they had to find another way, as they did not want to put stress on the building's frame. They came to the conclusion that the frame of the building must be modified, requiring over sixty thousand dollars. Workers got to add the mast, and then construction was halted due to the danger to pedestrians, all that work for nothing. Ultimately, the mooring mast never fulfilled its intended purpose, showcasing the complexities and unforeseen challenges of innovative architectural endeavors.
1735	16568	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building were faced with immediate problems when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The media hardship that they faced was placing a mooring mast on top of an already completed building. ""A thousand foot dirigible... would add stress to the building's frame."" (∂ 1) Not to mention that a large dirigible would also have placed stress on the building. Completing such a project would be extremely difficult because the building was not designed for docking dirigibles; therefore, the roof and the top floors would need to be converted to accommodate passengers and travel operations. Nature was also an obstacle that builders faced. High winds could cause the dirigible to violently sway. Weights used to tether the dirigibles could also be a safety hazard in a densley populated area such as New York City. Fire was another safety concern for the builders. The gases used to keep the dirigibles airborne were highly flammable and would again cause serious concern for safety in a city of millions. Ultimately all of these factors caused the creation of a mooring mast on the Empire State Building to fail."
1736	16569	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle the builders faced was the winds on top of the building. The winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even though the dirigibles were tied down to the mast, the ship would swivel around the mooring mast. This would make it unsafe for passengers and pedestrians attempting to disembark or observe. Another issue with landing the dirigibles on the Empire State Building was safety. Most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by a fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, owners of the Empire State Building realized that such an accident would be much worse in downtown New York. Ultimately, the dangers and impracticalities outweighed the novelty, leading to the abandonment of the dirigible docking idea.
1737	16570	6	3	"While building the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. One of the first obstacles faced was competition. Al Smith, the governor of New York was determined to have the tallest building in the world, beating the Chrysler building which was also being constructed. This created an obstacle because it put pressure on Al Smith and the builders to makes such a miraculous, tall building. A second obstacle faced by the builders was having to create a successful mooring mast on top of the building that wouldn't harm the structure of the building itself. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" Over one million dollars worth of changes had to be made to the framework. The last obstacle was all the work put into the mooring mast for it to even be able to work, as it was ultimately impractical. It was dangerous for dirigibles to land there, because the dirigibles were highly flammable. Winds were harsh and unsafe, and there was a law prohibiting the aircraft flying so low. These combined challenges ultimately made the mooring mast idea unfeasible, demonstrating the complex hurdles overcome during the Empire State Building's construction."
1738	16571	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a lot of obstacles while trying to build it. Some of these obstacles revolved around a proposed plan to have a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building. It was thought that the mooring, held by a single table, would add undue stress to the building's base. The wind conditions at the top of the building, which constantly shifted due to violent air currents, posed another challenge. These shifting winds would make the back of the airship swivel uncontrollably. Furthermore, there was the significant concern regarding the use of hydrogen and helium for the airships, as these gases are extremely flammable, adding a substantial safety risk. These are just some of the obstacles the builders faced while trying to make the Empire State Building taller and more innovative.
1739	16572	6	3	The Empire State Building had to face dangerous conditions every day like strong winds, heavy lifting of materials, and high heights, requiring careful planning and safety measures to ensure the well-being of workers and the structural integrity of the building.
1740	16573	6	3	"After reading The mooring mast, by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced with in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are evident. The number one reason is because it is not safe. First, most dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flamable. The chance of a fire starting is especially not good because its a highly populated area. Also, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"" (∂@NUM1). With the building being so high,"" winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (∂@NUM1). These unpredictable winds made docking a dangerous proposition, risking damage to both the airship and the building. The conclusion has been made the dirigibles land in landing fields because they can be weighted down in the back with lead weights. This method would not be safe if used on the Empire State Building. Clearly, the builders of the Empire State Building faced too many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there."
1741	16574	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The primary problem was the issue of safety. Most dirigibles were using highly flammable gases such as hydrogen. This could be a detrimental problem if the dirigible ever caught fire above New York's public. Another problem was working with nature. There were violent air currents constantly shifting atop the building, causing the back of ships to swivel around the mooring mast. The dirigibles couldn't simply be weighed down in the back, because that would be a safety hazard. The last problem builders faced was the law. At the time, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over cities. To tie up a ship to the Empire State Building would be considered illegal, thus preventing the successful implementation of the dirigible docking plan.
1742	16575	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many difficulties and obstacles during the process of creating the great building. The creators had planned for it to be the tallest building in existence, but they were thwarted by the engineer of the Chrysler Building. They put a new top onto their building, making it forty-six feet taller than the Empire State. To match these men, Al Smith decided to add a crown of his own to the building. He built a mooring at the 102nd floor that would accommodate dirigible travel. Once it was put in place he needed to make it compatible with the dirigibles through adjustments to the frame. Six thousand dollars were spent to remodel the frame of the building in hopes of making it compatible. They also needed to find safe ways to dock the blimps, which proved challenging. They were unable to find ways to extend an electric winch that could safely secure the airships. Balloons were powered by flammable gases too, a significant safety hazard in a big city environment. Plus, weights could not be hanging over city streets in order to weigh down the ship during docking. These problems made the dirigible popularity drop quite a lot, so the mooring was never used to its full potential, ultimately rendering the ambitious addition largely impractical.
1743	16576	6	3	"In the passage, The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are outlined. These obstacles were safety, nature, and law. Safety was an obstacle because the passengers on the dirigibles would be put in danger. This is evident in the line, ""...dirigibles from outside of the @LOCATION1 used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The dirigibles could have blown up, as many have in the past, creating a catastrophe. Nature was an obstacle because the dirigibles could have a hard time attaching to the mast if the weather is undesirable. This is supported in the quotation, ""...winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The wind could cause the dirigibles to move around uncontrollably, which wouldn't be very safe for anyone attempting to disembark. There was a law against airships in urban areas that was an obstacle. This law is explained in the quotation, ""this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" This law made it unnecessary to have the mooring mast, as it could not be legally used, regardless of safety and weather conditions. The obstacles outlined in the passage The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, allowed the architects to avoid wasting funds on something that wouldn't be profitable."
1744	16577	6	3	In the process of building the Empire State Building, there were many obstacles for the builders. Al Smith, who was the one who designed the building, wanted to make the building taller. He did this by attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on a mooring mast at the top of the building, reaching 1,250 feet high. There were obstacles in the way of attaining this goal. Safety was the greatest reason why it was never used as a docking station. Hydrogen was used in the dirigibles, which was highly flammable. An accident had already occurred having to do with a dirigible, called Hindenburg, in New Jersey. As popular as New York is they couldn't take the risk of putting harmful, dangerous gases in a densely populated area. Another problem that occurred to stop this building from being used as a mooring mast was the powerful wind currents that constantly shifted. The dirigible would be dangling high over pedestrians swivelling around because of the wind, this made it very unsafe and not even practical. One last reason the Empire State Building would not be able to have a mooring mast in which dirigibles could land was because there was a law which stated airships were not allowed too low over urban areas. These were some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in their ambitious, but ultimately unrealized, plan for airship docking.
1745	16578	6	3	In this excerpt the builders of the Empire State Building were faced with many problems trying to build a dock for dirigibles. The first problem they were faced with was how could they put this much stress on the building's structure, as mentioned in paragraph @NUM1, detailing the immense weight and wind resistance the mooring mast would create. Another problem the workers faced was the safety of the city people below. What if the dirigible caught on fire like the Hindenburg, and all the pedestrians below would be in danger? Also, the buildings around it would be in harm's way too. As stated in paragraph @NUM2, the dock was never really meant for use, with only one attempted docking that proved extremely difficult and dangerous due to high winds. I think they just wanted a reason to make the building taller than the Chrysler Building, prioritizing height and prestige over practical functionality.
1746	16579	6	3	Everyone would like to jump in a dirigible and transport from one location to the next. Although, there are many challenges the builders faced in attempt to doing so. One of these challenges included the amount of stress the single cable tether from the dirigible would add to the building. Also, wind pressure is a dangerous factor which needed to be taken into consideration, because the dirigible is so heavy, that it could easily fly off and hit someone. The building would also have to be strengthened to hold the dirigible which would cost over sixty thousand dollars. One of the most important reasons against allowing the dirigible to dock there is because it could easily catch on fire. The greatest reason was one of safety: Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is very flammable. (para @NUM1) Considering these serious safety implications, and the considerable costs associated with infrastructure upgrades, it is clear that the risks far outweigh the potential benefits of allowing dirigible docking at the location. Overall, due to the dangerous factors in allowing the dririgible to dock there, these will always override the pros, and maybe one day technology can create a safe way to do so.
1747	16580	6	3	One of the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced was that the airship couldn't moor at the Empire State Building because the winds on top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents. Another obstacle the builders faced was that there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, a regulation that posed a legal challenge. This law would make it illegal for airships if they ever tried to approach the area, further complicating the already ambitious plan. These significant hurdles ultimately contributed to the failure of the airship mooring concept.
1748	16581	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles and they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock. The first problem was the overall safety. Dirigibles that were built outside the U. S required the use of hydrogen, instead of non-flammable helium. Hydrogen is an extremely flammable gas that poses great danger. An example of this was when the Hindenburg was destroyed on May 6, 1937 in Lakehurst, New Jersey. It finally occurred, that if a dirigible was destroyed over a densely populated area, it could potentially hurt a lot more people. A second obstacle that builders had to face was nature itself. At that altitude, there were violent air currents causing winds to constantly shift. This was a danger to the landing of dirigibles too. Even if a dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back would keep swaying. It would be harder to dock passengers, and allow for inspections. Also, dirigibles would typically weighted down with lead weights. However, because it was so high up, this was not practical or safe. The last obstacle these builders had to face were laws. One specific law did not allow airships to fly too low over urban areas. It was also illegal for the airship to tie up or even aproach the building. Ultimately, these safety, environmental, and legal obstacles denied the potential of the mooring mast, rendering it an impractical feature.
1749	16582	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many challenges by attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem, presented in paragraph nine, was that they hadn't originally designed the building to hold a one thousand foot dirigible with a single rope. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building... would add stress to the building's frame."" To compensate, they had to reinforce the building to handle this new stress. The second problem, introduced in paragraph thirteen, was that the dirigibles are made out of a dangerous element: ""Hydrogen is very flammable."" The Empire State building builders did not want to take their chances over such a populated area, as a hydrogen leak could have catastrophic consequences. In paragraph fourteen, the reader learns that wind speed at the top of the building far surpassed wind speed in other places that dirigibles could be docked. This was a problem because when they normally tied down the back end of the dirigible with a rope & lead, they could no longer do so because of the location that they desired to dock it. The excessive wind made securing the airships incredibly difficult and dangerous. The builders of the Empire State building attempted to fight architectural flaws, dirigibles' safety flaws, and the flaws of nature to allow dirigibles to dock there, which ultimately didn't work out due to a combination of structural, safety, and environmental challenges."
1750	16583	6	3	"Al Smith had incredible vision with his plans for the Empire State Building. However, his excitement about dirigibles being allowed to dock at the top of the building, blinded him to the obvious obstacles in the way. Dirigibles themselves, were not safe modes of transportation. Hydrogen is very flammable, and would not be safe near large crowds of people, like in an urban area like New York. From a practical viewpoint the mooring mast would not work either, because of the high elevation. The height of the building would have violent winds made it difficult for dirigibles to land for passengers to disembark. The final major problem was that there was a law stating that airships were not to fly too low over urban areas. Irvan Clavan summed it up when he said ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear."" The vision of airship docking, despite its initial appeal, was ultimately impractical due to safety concerns, logistical challenges, and legal restrictions. However, technology soon made dirigibles outdated, rendering the entire concept obsolete."
1751	16584	6	3	"The main problem of dirigibles landing by the Empire State Building was safety. For one reason dirigibles were huge; ""Some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City."" The Empire State building is 1,250 ft tall. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" and the dirigible's large surface area would make it difficult to control. If a dirigible was going to land on a very windy day it had the potential of crashing into other buildings which would cut through the dirigibles materials, possibly causing a catastrophic tear or explosion. Also on the tethering to the mooring mast, would ""weigh down in the back with lead weights..."" the idea was dangerous because the dirigible's immense size and the unpredictable winds could put extreme stress on the mooring system. To hold the dirigible to the building there would be lead weights, ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe"" should those weights break loose. Due to all these problems the dirigible would never be safe to land on the mooring mast, and it was these substantial safety concerns that ultimately grounded the ambitious plan."
1752	16585	6	3	"There were many reasons that the mooring mast couldn't be used. The first reason is wind speeds. In fact ""in 1930, the @ORGANIZATION1 dirigible, Los Angeles, approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie because of forceful winds."" Consequently, the dirigibles could not even get close enough to dock. Another reason was safety. In 1937 the German dirigible, Hindenburg, went down because of a fire, highlighting the dangers of these massive airships. That situation could've been a lot worse if the dirigible went down on heavily populated areas, in which thousands of people might die. The last reason is that there is a law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban are urban areas. Therefore it would be illegal for a dirigible to get close enough to dock, making the mooring mast concept impractical from a legal standpoint. These factors combined effectively rendered the mooring mast unusable."
1753	16586	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building faced several obstacles throughout the building procedure. First, many of the dirigibles were filled with hydrogen gas rather than helium and ""hydrogen is highly flammable."" Following the German dirigible Hindenburg disaster, Empire State Building owners ""realized how much worse the accident could have been,"" and this resulted in the decision not to utilize the mast as a docking area. Also, when Al Smith decided to build the additional mooring mast onto the top of the building, due to the weight of the docking blimps, the architects had to invest ""over $500,000"" to modify the building's framework and enable it to support the weight of a dangling blimp. Moreover, due to violent winds, the docking dirigibles could not properly land and ""were constantly shifting."" Lead weights couldn't be used because of the dangers and impracticalities the idea could set on the streets below. Finally, it seems that the overall safety and practicality of the mooring mast weren't easily attainable. Al Smith states himself that the engineers are ""trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement."" Hence, the builders of the Empire State experienced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building."
1754	16587	6	3	"The ability to dock dirigibles atop the Empire State Building, while initially lucrative, had major obstacles. The problems facing the development of the mooring mast would be cost, flammability of dirigibles, and weather over 1000 feet in the air. The structural and cost problems facing Al Smith was that ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" In order to overcome this obstacle, ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and... over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications would have to be made."" This is problematic because Al Smith now must spend more time and money than originally planned, impacting the overall profitability of the venture. Furthermore, another problem is that ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This is a huge obstacle because a fire or explosion ""above a densely populated areas such as downtown New York"", would be catastrophic and could put thousands of people in harms way, making the project ethically questionable. Finally the weather at the top of the Empire State building is unsuitable for docking dirigibles: ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting... the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This is dangerous to the structure of the building, surrounding buildings, and people close by, further increasing the risks associated with the endeavor. Due to these problems, Al Smith and the engineers could not complete the Mooring Mast, ultimately rendering the initial vision of airborne docking impractical and unsafe."
1755	16588	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on it. These obstacles took precaution of safety, nature itself, and the law. The first obstacle was one of safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Owners of the Empire State Building realized that if a dirigible was destroyed by fire, it would cause a huge accident, especially with the highly flammable hydrogen. Also, this accident would be devastating because it'd take place over the densely populated area of downtown New York. In addition, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These would cause the back of the ship to swivel around the mooring mast, making docking dangerous. Dirigibles that are moored in open fields use weights to be weighed down. Yet, these can't be used on top of the Empire State Building because they'd be dangling about walking pedestrians which is dangerous. Lastly, a major obstacle faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building was the ""existing law against airships to fly too low over urban areas."" @CAPS1, this would make it illegal for a ship to tie to the building or even approach the area, immediately halting any progress on the project. Overall, the obstacles faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building lead to the disappearance of this idea altogether."
1756	16589	6	3	Builders of the Empire State Building faced different challenges while considering a dirigible dock. They needed to ensure safe passenger disembarkation on the platform. The dock also had to be high enough, so the owner could maintain the world's highest building record. A small addition wouldn't suffice, making a dock a more substantial solution to achieve the desired height and functionality, ensuring the building's prominence.
1757	16590	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building encountered both man-made problems and problems from nature while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One main problem was the building's strength. The building's steel was not nearly strong enough to ""transmit pressure from the dirigible's load to the building's foundation."" Also, ""the winds at the top of the building were always moving and full of violent air currents,"" which would shove the Zeppelin into the edges of the building. It was prohibited for airships to fly too low over urban areas, and so making it illegal for a ship to even dock to the building. Price was also a factor; along with the building's cost, an additional sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework just to make the building strong enough to accommodate an airship. Through all of those problems the builders encountered, no wonder dirigibles docking at the mooring mast was not possible."
1758	16591	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, the morning mast there were CONSIDERABLE obstacals builders faced attempting to allow dirigibles to DOCK on the empire State Building. Building a 1250 ft tall building was hard adding a Mast Would be even harder. Allowing a dirigible land and on the empire State building would be dangerous. The german dirigible the HINDENBURG Was destroyed causeing MILLIONS of damage. ""The owners of the empire State building realized how much worse that accident could have been If It had taken Place above a densely Populated area Such as down town"". There fore The mast was Put up but never was used as a dirigible DOCK. Ultimately, safety concerns outweighed the potential benefits, leading to the mast's disuse for its intended purpose."
1759	16592	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, there are many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced. The task of building something on the Empire State Building that would allow dirigibles to dock there was a daring and dangerous job. There were many obstacles the builders faced. One obstacle was the winds. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would make building very difficult because everything would get blown around, including the heavy steel beams they were working with. Another obstacle was that ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" That means the builders first had to make the building strong enough to hold the docking place before they could start building the docking place. This required additional time and resources. These two obstacles that the builders faced made building the docking place much harder. It took much longer because they first had to make the frame of the building stronger. Also they had to watch the wind so that they would not get hurt, slowing down their progress even more."
1760	16593	6	3	The obsticals that the airship companies had with docking the Dirigibles were that even though they would be tied up in the front, the back end would still swivel in the wind, making it difficult to load and unload passengers and cargo safely. They couldn't put little weights on the back because if they ever fell they would injure podestriens. And there was a law past ships couldn't dock on buildings or even come close to rural areas, further restricting potential docking locations. That is some of the obsticals the workers faced, highlighting the challenges in safely maneuvering and securing these large airships in urban environments given the existing regulations.
1761	16594	6	3	Technology was not caught up to the dirigibles; they could not dock because neither the building nor the dirigible had the right equipment. This was one obstacle the Empire State Building's builders faced, especially when considering logistics, for instance, delivering newspapers. Ultimately, this limitation highlighted a technological gap that affected planned functionalities.
1762	16595	6	3	"One of the obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was to strengthen the frame of the building. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below (paragraph @NUM1)."" If the building was not strengthen, all that stress and force would collapse the building. Another obstacle faced to the perfection of docking dirigibles was modifying it's safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable (paragraph @NUM2)."" If a dirigible were to be destroyed by fire in downtown New York, I guarantee a really serious hazardous accident. Downtown New York is densely populated, a destroyed dirigible in downtown New York puts in danger the passengers of the dirigible and the pedestrians of downtown. Other than the two obstacles explained above, nature is another obstacle to the Empire State Building. Strong winds can affect the Building or even the dirigible. ""The winds on Top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents (paragraph @NUM3)."" Violent winds could force the back of the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast. A swiveling ship above pedestrians is no where close to safe. The law enforces that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. Flying too low over urban areas, once again, puts both pedestrians and passengers in state of danger. The dirigible could be blown by the wind and blow onto a sharp spire of other buildings in the area. These are the obstacles faced in docking a dirigible successfully."
1763	16596	6	3	The architects of the mooring mast were blind to the amount of problems that could have arisen. Balloons are not very strong and if they didn't already know, it's windy on the top of the Empire State Building. The wind could drive the dirigible right into its spikey doom. They had no real way of keeping the dirigible contained because usually lead blocks held it down. From 102 stories in the air, that wasn't the safest plan, especially with the turbulent updrafts. Also, most non-U.S. dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium. In a crowded New York City, a fireball like that would be devastating due to hydrogen being highly flammable, and there was no practical fire suppression system in place. The builders really should have planned this out better, considering all the potential dangers.
1764	16597	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building (@ORGANIZATION2) had many obstacles to face when building the mooring mast for dirigibles to dock. Top winds, the flammability of the foreign ships, and airspace laws all hindered the production of the blimp dock. Very high up in New York, the winds are dangerous, especially at the top of such a tall building. If a blimp tried to dock there, the back would be whipped around and could end up harming someone on the ground. Being that high up, that's dangerous. Many foreign dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, which is extremely flammable as witnessed with the Hindenburg disaster. When that happened, the owners of the @ORGANIZATION2 thought it was too risky having those things flying over highly populated areas like New York City. There were laws made prohibiting low aircrafts over densely populated urban areas, so there could be no docking or they'd be breaking the law every time they did. That wasn't a risk the owner's wanted to take, given the potential for legal repercussions. The idea of the mooring mast was a very under- thought idea. Builders forgot the wind, flammability of Ships, and airspace laws would all end up stopping the mast's success. Now the @ORGANIZATION2 just has a long, useless pole on top of it, a testament to the impracticality of the initial design.
1765	16598	6	3	"The weight was an obstacle they faced. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. The stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" The weight of the dirigible would be too heavy for the frame because the frame wasn't initially designed to support that much additional weight. Some dirigibles were highly flammable: ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" They felt that this flammability was too dangerous, especially since the building was located in a densely populated area. The air pressure was another obstacle that was faced. ""Fearing the winds would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell...."" The unpredictable wind gusts at that altitude posed a significant risk. The last obstacle was the law. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."" This law effectively prohibited dirigibles from landing at the Empire State Building due to its location within the city. Therefore, due to structural, safety, and legal concerns, the plan to use the Empire State Building as a dirigible mooring station proved ultimately unfeasible."
1766	16599	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof."" A major problem was that a thousand-foot dirigible would add too much stress to the frame. ""The stress of the dirigibles load and as the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" That was another obstacle the builder's had to overcome considering the foundation was eleven hundred feet below, requiring careful consideration of load distribution. The Empire State building then had to be strengthened and modified in order to build a stronger foundation for the mooring of a dirigible upon the Empire State Building. These structural challenges represented significant hurdles in realizing the ambitious vision of a mid-air docking station. Those were some of the many obstacles the builder's went through in designing the mast."
1767	16600	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" there were some obstacles that the builders faced. Some of the obstacles that were faced had to do with the strength of the frame. The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast to top the building's flat roof because it would stress the frame too much. So over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had been made to the building's framework, including reinforcing the steel structure. Another obstacle was that the mooring mast was never destined to fulfill its purpose, ultimately rendering the costly structural changes somewhat futile."
1768	16601	6	3	"The architects building the Empire State Building encountered a big problem when trying to put the mooring mast on the very top. The second sentence in paragraph @CAPS1 states, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" Although the architects faced many problems this was the biggest, as the envisioned mooring of a dirigible posed significant structural challenges. This meant that they would have to change the building's structure in order to make it work. It says in the bottom of paragraph @CAPS1 that over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made, demonstrating the extent of the issue and the resources needed to address it. Ultimately, the mooring mast concept, despite its initial appeal, required costly adjustments to the building's design."
1769	16602	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State building face a good amount of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock upon it's mast. The wind proved to be a very big problem for the blimps. Not only would they swing about dangerously when tethered to the mast, that on the few occasions that a dirigible actually approached the Empire state building, they couldn't manuver close enough due to the wind. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Another thing that stood in the way of the Empire State Building's dock being used was the danger it presented to the buildings and people below. The gas, hydrogen, that dirigibles used to float is highly flammable. ""When the German dirigible was destroyed by fire,... the owners... realized how much worse the accident would have been... above a densely populated area."" This heightened the concern for potential disasters in a crowded city. The third and final obstacle they faced was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" This regulation effectively nullified any practical use of the mooring mast. With all that potential danger and discouragement, it's no wonder the Empire State building was never used for docking dirigibles."
1770	16603	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether that would add stress to the building's frame. Another obstacle was that the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted to the building's foundation, nearly eleven hundred feet below. Even though the steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation, this cost over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications, ultimately proving to be an impractical and ultimately abandoned endeavor.
1771	16604	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced quite a few obstacles in making a dirigible docking stations. One of the main things was that there was a law in place that banned the use of low flying aircrafts in urban areas, like New York City. Another reason is that it was just not safe to dock these massive blimps that high. Almost 1,250 feet up the winds would have been very violent, and with the tailend of the dirigible not being fastened down, it was very likely that it could get spun around and end up tangled with the mast. Also it was not safe because many foreign blimps were filled with hydrogen which was highly flamable, and if an accident similar to the Hindenburg with fire occurred over in urban place like New York City it could have been very tragic. Lastly in order to build the mast builders had to re inforce the frame of the building so that it could bear the stress that such a station would put on the structure, ultimately adding to the complexity and cost of the project.
1772	16605	6	3	"In the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State building, builders were faced with several different obstacles. One obstacle the builders faced was how they were going to modify the building to be able to support a ""thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether,"" because it would add too much stress to the buildings frame. Another obstacle along with the modifications to the buildings' frame was the money. Building this new structure would cost, ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications"" for a service that was ultimately unproven. One of the most important obstacles however was safety. Although most blimps in the united states use helium, outside countries mainly use hydrogen. Hydrogen, being highly flammable, was absolutely out of the question to be in a city as highly and densely populated as New York. The other safety hazards included the winds which were, ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" because the back of the blimp could not be weighed down and also ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" which would make their attempts not only dangerous, but illegal. Ultimately, these significant engineering, financial, and safety concerns proved insurmountable, and in the end, the mooring mast was never completed."
1773	16606	6	3	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacles. One of those obstacles was making sure that blimps and other air born transportations didn't interfere with the building. Also, another obstacle the builders had to deal with was making sure the docking areas were safe. Because if a blimp got too close to an urban city like New York City and had all those flammable fuels leak out, it would be a big disaster. These were significant obstacles the builders faced in their ambition to create the world's tallest building."
1774	16607	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1 many problems with the mast of the Empire State Building are explained. One of the many problems was that the large dirigible tied to the building mast would add stress to the building which could cause the building to collapse. But this problem was fixed by strengthening the building's foundation with added steel and concrete. A second problem with docking a dirigible at the Empire State Building was the highly flammable gases the dirigible used to become lighter than air, specifically hydrogen. If the dirigible were to catch fire its metal frame could fall to the ground endangering citizens below. The last danger would be that while the dirigible was docked strong air currents coming off of the building could cause the dirigible's tail to spin around on the mast, making the mooring process unstable. One way to fix this would be to place lead weights on the back of the ship to improve stability. But if one of these weights fell off of the dirigible it could potentially harm pedestrians below. Because of these problems, and the inherent dangers that could not be easily mitigated, the mast could never be used for its intended purpose."
1775	16608	6	3	When designing the dock for dirigibles on the top of the Empire State Building, there were several obstacles that the architects and the engineers were faced with. One problem was they couldn't effectively drop the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building because it was too heavy for the frame of the building. So, because of that problem, the architects and engineers had to come up with a way to modify the frame of the building so that the building could put up with the added stress of the mooring mast. Another problem that they were faced with was that it was also too dangerous. It was deemed dangerous because most dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, which was extremely flammable, and they couldn't risk having a disaster similar to the Hindenburg happen 102 floors above city streets that were crowded with people. So, those were a few obstacles that architects were faced with when building the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building.
1776	16609	6	3	The @CAPS1 says the greatest obstacle would be nature itself. The wind would blow the blimps on to the sharp spires of other buildings, posing a significant navigation challenge and a constant threat to the blimps' structural integrity. Therefore, controlling blimps in such conditions requires advanced technology.
1777	16610	6	3	The builders faced many problems that should have been foreseen. Perhaps the greatest reason was because the builders of @CAPS1 dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium as their gas choice. Because hydrogen is highly flammable it would have spelled doom for New York if exploded. The weather also created a great risk, especially considering docking a dirigible there; the violent air currents shifted constantly. The use of lead weights would put pedestrians at risk below. That idea was neither safe or practical given the circumstances. Probably one of the most obvious risks was the law itself. There was a law that stated that airships can't fly too low over urban areas, adding another layer of complexity. Because of these reasons, it made making the Empire State Building a landing area inherently unsafe and ultimately unfeasible.
1778	16611	6	3	After finishing the @ORGANIZATION1 Empire State Building, architects wanted to start mooring dirigibles right away. However, due to three potential problems the architect had never realized before, they never could moor any dirigibles. One problem was the most @CAPS1 large dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium. This was a problem because hydrogen is extremely flammable, and after the Hindenburg @CAPS2 blew up in @ORGANIZATION2 Lakehurst, architects feared a similar catastrophe could happen in @CAPS3 New York City, but many more would die. Another problem was high winds. Because it was so windy at the top of the building, it was almost impossible to hold the dirigibles steady. Also, the dirigible would have swiveled while tied to the building because there was nothing holding down the front and back. The third issue was that there was a law against flying dirigibles at the height that was necessary to moor on the Empire State Building. That's why, ultimately, no dirigibles ever successfully moored on the Empire State Building, concluding the ambitious but ultimately unrealizable plan.
1779	16612	6	3	"There were many obstacles the builder of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First off as stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building... would add stress to the building's frame."" This shows an obstacle because in order to enable this to happen, over @MONEY1 of funds would be needed, specifically around $2 million. The funds leading to the strengthening and modification of the steel frame. Thus needing to redo the fundamental building blocks of the operation. Second the greatest concern was safety. This is brought to hand because most dirigibles are very flammable. They consist of Helium, which is an extremely flammable gas. Also if the dirigible were to mount to the top of the Empire State Building, the back of it would be swaying around and around, potentially due to strong winds at that height. This possibly having a chance of dis-mounting and it crashing into a densely populated area of people. These are some reasons that the obstacles of attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the top of the Empire State Building ultimately proved insurmountable, making the concept impractical."
1780	16613	6	3	"While constructing the Empire State Building, the builders were faced with many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One such obstacle that the builders had overcome was the law that prevented airships (i.e., planes or dirigibles) from flying too low over urban areas. In paragraph @NUM1, we learn that ""[this law] would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" This legal hurdle presented a significant challenge to the entire concept of dirigible docking. Another obstacle the building crew of the Empire State Building was faced with when constructing the mooring mast was nature itself. Because of the violent wind currents near the top of the building, the way the wind blew constantly changed, causing a great difficulty for any dirigible to connect to the mast properly. In paragraph @NUM2, we are told about how if it were possible to connect the mast to a dirigible that the back would swing. ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighed down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the Street, was neither practical or safe."" This made balancing the airship during docking an almost impossible task. Because there were too many obstacles with not enough safe options, the mooring mast project was shut down; proving that during its construction its builders were faced with too many obstacles, ultimately rendering the dirigible docking plan unfeasible."
1781	16614	6	3	"To design a mast for the dirigibles to land was no easy matter; architects could not just plop a mooring mast on top of the @ORGANIZATION1 flat roof. The stress from a thousand-foot dirigible would transmit weight and wind pressure all the way to the foundation. To be able to create this mast, the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened. First, the architects ""designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself."" This rocket-shaped mast would have four wings at its corners of aluminum and would rise to a conical roof that would house the mooring arm. For the winches and control machinery for the dirigible mooring, they would be placed in the back of the machinery space. Finally, when this was all completed, the existing plans for the building were to be put in place, allowing the grand structure to accommodate both its original design and the ambitious addition of the airship mooring mast."
1782	16615	6	3	"There were many obstacles which the builders of the mooring mast had to face. They thought it was going to be an easy task to accomplish as shown in paragraph eight where Al Smith was asked about the mooring mast and he responded ""[It's] on the level, all right. No kidding. We're working on the thing now."" This shows how truly sure Smith was about the goal's simplicity. Although determination was a great factor in the building of this world wide known monument, problems kept standing in the way of success. For example in paragraph two the author describes how the Empire State Building would not be able to fulfill it's purpose, even though workers should've known better. She states ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Challenges kept pouring down, one of them being nature. Finally the workers gave up after the project was postpone due to mainly safety reasons. By the late 1930's, the idea of the mooring mast had almost disappeared. All that really matters is that they tried, and all it took was just one dream to attempt something so ambitious."
1783	16616	6	3	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State building faced a few problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the first problems they faced was safety, considering the volatile nature of the gases used in the airships. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (L¸sted, @NUM1). The builders would have to keep this in mind and implement safeguards against potential explosions. The next obstacle they faced was nature and its winds, which proved to be quite turbulent at such heights. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents,"" (@NUM2). The winds would be a major problem that the builders would have to face because it is so unpredictable, making docking a dangerous maneuver. Lastly, the builders had to worry about the law pertaining to airships flying too low over urban areas, specifically New York City. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area,"" (@NUM3). The builders of the Empire State Building had to face the difficulties of safety, nature, and the law in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, ultimately making the ambitious plan impractical."
1784	16617	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles such as safety, nature, and law in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The issue of safety became apparent because most dirigibles made outside of the United States were made with highly flammable hydrogen rather than helium. To risk the destruction of one atop such a bustling city would be devastating. Nature too became a problem in the futile attempt of the builders. With such ""Violent air currents"" (∂ 1), the dirigible would swivel around even if it were tied up to the mooring mast. Finally, law was an obstacle to the builders. Existing legislation banned airships from ""flying too low over urban areas"" (∂ 2), meaning the dirigibles would have no way of landing atop the urban building. These obstacles such as safety, nature, and law ultimately hindered the attempt of allowing dirigibles to land on the Empire State Building."
1785	16618	6	3	In the age of airships, the docking of dirigibles had many issues. One, boarding passengers would be very difficult as the dirigible will drift away from a gust of wind. Second, the gases used to make them afloat are highly flammable, and explode quite easily, posing a significant safety risk. Therefore, dirigibles presented considerable logistical and safety challenges.
1786	16619	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to have dirigibles dock there. First off, it was a huge safety issue; ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen... hydrogen is highly flamible"" (paragraph @NUM1). If an accident happened (lets say to the magnitude of the Hindenburg) over New York City, thousands of people could die because of this highly flamible substance. Secondly a very large problem was to successfully use the mooring mast. ""The winds at the top of the building work constantly shifting due to air currents"" (paragraph @NUM2). If the wind was out of controll and the dirigible wasn't tied down right, the harsh winds could be dangerously dangeling over the people of New York. These issues along with cost concerns, made this vision an impractical idea. Amongst many other reasons and the use of common sense, it is clear that the construction of this mooring mast should never have ever been thought of as a reality."
1787	16620	6	3	"In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted you learn about the plans for the Empire State Building but, you also learn why the Mooring Mast cannot be used for it's original purpose. The Mooring Mast was planned to be used as a docking station for dirigibles, or blimps. One reason why the Mooring Mast could not dock these is because places outside of the U.S. used hydrogen instead of helium. The excerpt states ""Most dirigibles outside of the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium, which is highly flammable."" (∂ @NUM1) So they did not want a huge fire in a highly populated area. Another reason why it would not work was violent air currents. The excerpt states ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would be wirled around the mooring mast."" (∂ @NUM2) Faced with that problem they would have to worry about the mast being taken out by the large airships. The last reason is because of a law. The excerpt states ""an existing law against airships flying too lower over urban areas"" (∂ @NUM3) The building mast was to close to humans to let them dock there. The mooring mast, initially envisioned as a hub for transatlantic air travel, simply presented too many logistical and safety challenges to overcome, making its original purpose unachievable. So, while the mast was a brilliant idea it could not be done; now it is only a dream."
1788	16621	6	3	The builders and architects of the Empire State Building faced many problems trying to dock dirigibles at the top. The first problem was that there were very strong winds near the top of the building, which made it extremely hard for a captain to control their ship. When anchored to the mast by a single tether, the dirigible would be twisted around the spire by the winds, making it nearly impossible to transfer passengers or cargo safely. Another important issue that builders could not overcome was the fact that the streets below the Empire State Building were densely populated. This meant that a disaster similar to the Hindenburg tragedy in New Jersey could cause many more casualties in New York City, a risk that was unacceptable. Lastly, one of the most obvious obstacles that the builders could not get past was the existing law against airships flying over urban areas. This law made it illegal to fly a dirigible at a height that would be necessary for docking on the mast of the Empire State Building, effectively prohibiting the entire operation. With these obstacles in their way, the builders of the Empire State Building could most likely never accomplish their dream of docking dirigibles on the mast.
1789	16622	6	3	"An obstacle the builders of the Empire State building was weight. If the story it says ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame. The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation, which was nearly 55 feet below."" This immense weight and the forces it exerted posed a significant engineering challenge. Another obstacle was nature. The story says ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was Nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" These unpredictable conditions ultimately rendered the dirigible mooring concept impractical."
1790	16623	6	3	"The architects had to go through many obstacles such as having to rebuild the whole frame of the Empire State building. In paragraph nine it says ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof."" They had to modify and strengthened the whole thing to accommodate the new situation. Another obstacle they had to face, was that hydrogen was highly flammable. When a German dirigible was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the owners of the Empire State Building realized that an accident like that could be worse in the crowded streets of New York. Another obstacle was nature itself. In paragraph ten it says ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The back of the ship would swivel around, but could be held down with lead weights, but like paragraph ten says ""using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling, is neither practical nor safe."" Therefore, these challenges made the endeavor of mooring airships to the Empire State Building ultimately impractical."
1791	16624	6	3	"The obstacles of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles dock there were immense. For example, it would have been almost impossible to dock with the violent winds blowing at that height. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"". It would not have been feasible to land a dirigible there because the text is saying the winds at that height were not stable and that the ship would be tossing and turning in the air. Another obstacle the building's designers faced was the law of airships flying too low to the ground. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" That's saying that even if a dirigible could moor at the Empire State Building, it's illegal because all airships have to fly a certain height over urban area. The workers building the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The obstacles were just too great to overcome. Thus no dirigibles have successfully docked there, and none ever will."
1792	16625	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building were faced with many obstacles. Allowing dirigibles to dock on the mast would be too complex, which the builders did not realize at first. The most complex obstacle was how the builders were going to securely tie the blimp down without it not only spinning around, but from ripping the building out of its foundation due to strong winds. The constructors also had to worry about if it was safe or not and if it was permitted by aviation authorities. Another major obstacle was that not only were the dirigibles too low to the ground to dock safely, but they were mostly made up of hydrogen instead of helium, which was very flammable and posed a significant risk. After all the hard work to be successful, Al Smith and his peers had to look out for the best interests of the people of New York by prioritizing their safety over ambitious docking plans.
1793	16626	6	3	"Dirigibles are large steel-frame balloons enclosed by cotton and filled with hydrogen and helium. In the early 1930's, the new idea came about that the dirigibles would dock at the top of the Empire State Building in New York. After reading The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, we have learned of the obstacles the builders were faced with. The author notes, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The wings on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". This made the docking process exceptionally difficult, as the massive airships were vulnerable to unpredictable gusts. The author also states, ""the other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This regulation aimed to prevent potential accidents and protect the densely populated city below. Due to the two main obstacles; nature and law, builders weren't able to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, ultimately rendering the mooring mast project impractical."
1794	16627	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building had numerous obstacles in their way if they planned on allowing dirigibles to dock there. The first and most serious problem was the safety of the passengers as well as pedestrians on the street below. Dirigibles are filled with hydrogen which is highly flammable. In 1937 in New Jersey the dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by a fire. This catastrophe would have been worse if it were take place over the heads of people in New York city. Nature also posed a huge threat to the completion of the docking mast. High winds and unpredictable weather at that altitude would make maneuvering these large airships incredibly difficult. Due to the air currents on the top of the building the blimp (dirigible) would constantly be shifting. The only way to control the swaying of the blimp would be to use weights to hold the blimp down, which would again put the public at risk. Along with natural hazards it would have been illegal for the blimps to dock at the Empire State building because of an existing law concerning aerial navigation and safety. Therefore, the idea to allow dirigibles to dock at a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building is completely impractical.
1795	16628	6	3	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there like nature, law, and of the sharp spire. Nature was probably the biggest problem because you can't control wind. The wind at the top of the Empire State Building were so strong cause ""... the back of the ship would swivel around and around..."" This would make it hard to land and unland the dirigibles, especially with the mooring mast proving to be an unstable anchor in such conditions. Law was also a problem. There was a law that prevented ""... airships flying too low over urban areas."" The spire at the top of the building was sharp enough to pop the dirigibles that flew over it. If a dirigible was to hit it, it would pop the dirigible and kill many people below, making the entire endeavor far too risky. Ultimately, these challenges proved insurmountable, and the dirigible docking plan was abandoned."
1796	16629	6	3	"The one obstacle the builders had when trying to build this building was not a way for the dirigibles landing to be convenient for all. The dirigibles have a very fast speed of eight miles per hour, and they were as big as four blocks of New York City, paragraph @NUM1, which made maneuvering them a challenge. This was a problem for the builders because the dirigibles were very big, and the building itself as well. The size was a problem because the enormous dirigibles would not be landing in the right space, potentially causing damage. Having a lack of time was always a problem because the building would not be completed on time, adding pressure. The builders always had to hold back because ""engineers consulted with experts... architects met with presidents"" paragraph @NUM2, meaning progress was often stalled for discussions. Holding back on the making of the building to meet with those people took away time, further complicating the project. When there is something very high, and wide in the way there will be a problem, and these factors combined to create significant construction challenges. Ultimately, these logistical and temporal constraints hindered the building's progress."
1797	16630	6	3	Some of the problems with the constructing of docking dirigibles were that natural causes like high winds, as said in ∂ 6, posed significant challenges to their stability and maneuverability. The dirigibles were highly flammable due to the use of hydrogen gases that made the dirigibles fly, creating a constant risk of fire. Also another important factor was that this project was being taken place in a highly populated area, which meant harm could be done civilians if anything ever went wrong, raising serious safety concerns for the surrounding communities. Therefore, these factors contributed to the inherent risks associated with dirigible construction.
1798	16631	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. A problem they had was the violent winds blowing the blimp around at a high altitude, with people onboard, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting,"" making docking a precarious endeavor. Another setback was the legality of such a maneuver; it was ""illegal for [a] ship to tie up to a building,"" presenting a legal hurdle. Also, it was dangerous for dirigibles that ran on hydrogen to dock because hydrogen is highly flammable, posing a significant safety risk. Ultimately, the Mooring Mast of the Empire State Building became nothing more than an attraction for sightseers, as the practical difficulties and safety concerns proved insurmountable."
1799	16632	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced included the fact that they could not moor airships to the building because there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. Despite this hurdle, two dirigibles did attempt to reach the building before the entire idea was dropped, highlighting the initial ambition despite the legal constraints.
1800	16633	6	3	"You want me to tell you what they had to go through in attempt to allow dirigibles dock there?! Well to tell you the truth they had to go through a lot, like ""one obstacle the lack of a suitable landing area"", also another ""obstacle I would have to say is nature""! let me tell you why I picked these to obstacles. Keep reading! They want to dock the dirigibles at the Empire State Building. I say want because there plan did not work; too many things was wrong. Like the fact that they said ""one obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing"" they couldn't find a good landing area for the dirigibles without something bad happening. Another ""obstacle they had was nature"" I say nature because if the wind blew it can blow away some people. So those are my main obstacles that they had to go through @CAPS1 to allow the dirigibles dock there, and ultimately these significant challenges prevented the successful implementation of the dirigible docking plan."
